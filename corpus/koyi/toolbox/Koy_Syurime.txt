\ft Even nowadays, we say Syurime is the father of the gods of the house, and we do puja to him, "do puja to me"
\ref Sjurime.128
\tx umu ʦukʦu mo-ni-lɔ oko pi jɔ kʰuiʔ-mu ʦʰo pi bi-mu ʦʰo siru-ʦɔ kʰɔlɔ hal-mu ʦʰo-nɔ mu-mu ʦʰo

\tx hetnɔ-ŋɔ m...-ma sjurime dʰusaba kʰɔlɔ-nɔ dʰubi repʦ-iki-m rep-mu ʦʰo
\ft Because he did this, we respect Syurime as the oldest of our gods.
