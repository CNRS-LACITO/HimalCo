\ref Origin.1
\ft A long long time ago, when we talk of man's creation, (we say) there were two gods in the sky above, Ruwahang and Paruhang.
\tx asina sumnima salama-bo sɔma tʰinʦ-a-m de-ki-lɔ ninambu-ʦoptu mu-ka ʦukʦu-ʦɔ ruwahaŋ paruhaŋ mɔ-ni-m ʦʰa
\ref Origin.2
\ft As for those called men, there were none on the earth.
\tx jo idɔ bakʰaju bi pu sɔma det-ka asu jɔ ɔ-mɔ-ni-m ʦʰa
\ref Origin.3
\tx sɔ lɔ sɔmɔ jɔ ɔ-gɔ-m ʦʰa
\ft There were not even stones or trees.
\ref Origin.4
\tx dʰaiʔlɔ uk ŋiʦi-bi bakʰaju-nɔ sopmu-lɔŋka ribipma pipi tʰinʦ-a ʦʰa
\ft Then, one day, from the breath of the earth, Ribipma was created.
\ref Origin.5
\tx dʰanɔ ribipma pipi-ja ja ebo ja ebo mu-to mu-to sɔlɔme ʦʰɔʔ ʦʰa
\ft And Ribipma, doing various things, turned into a young woman.
\ref Origin.6
\tx sɔlɔme ʦʰɔʔ-nɔ tɔpa lalu mu-mu lam-u
\ft And having become a young woman, she wanted to love a man.
\ref Origin.7
\tx dʰaiʔlɔ sɔma-ʦa asu jɔ a-mɔ-ni
\ft But there were no men.
\ref Origin.8
\tx dʰam wale-bi dʰam wale-bi silpi-ʦɔ mɔ-ni-m ʦʰa pipi-nɔ ŋɔsu kekewa mɔʔwa kɔretu mɔ-ni
\ft At that time there were only birds, and the bird and the thrush were the goddess' friends.
\ref Origin.9
\tx dʰaiʔlɔ pipi ne sɔlɔme ʦʰɔʔ-nɔ tɔpa ʦʰap-ka ʦʰɔʔ-lɔ hɔiʔ mu-mu hɔiʔ mu-mu ʦʰɔʔ-lɔ ja kʰuʦ-a ebo kʰuʦ-a ja hiʔ-ni ebo hiʔ-ni ʣara tum-mu-lɔ jɔ kɔpa ɔ-tum-a
\ft Then as she became a young woman she started to think about a husband, and she started to wonder "what shall I do?" and she went here and there, and asked here and there, and even searching, she didn't find one.
\ref Origin.10
\ft Then one day she came to know what she needed to do.
\tx dʰanɔ ne sɔmɔ mu-mu mu-mu ʦʰɔʔ-ʣa-lɔ sela ne sela uk malbɔ-bi tumtoʔd-u ʦʰa
\ref Origin.11
\ft She knew one day how to love a man.

\ft The goddess knew one day how to find a husband.  We say that this is how we find husbands:we climb up into a walnut tree and whistle,  and the wind comes.
\ref Origin.13
\tx dʰanɔ hjuʔ-wa hjuʔ pu lanʦupa tɔpa mɔ-di-m ʦʰa
\ft And the wind is like a husband.
\ref Origin.14

\ft It is said that one loves a husband when the wind comes, and after learning this she climbed up the walnut tree and whistled.
\ref Origin.15
\ft Then she climbed up in the walnut tree and whistled.
\tx dʰaiʔlɔ ne pipi ne kursi-bi huŋ-a-nɔ susula mu ʦʰa
\ref Origin.16
\ft The grandfather came and loved her.
\tx dʰailɔ ʦukʦu hɔ-di-nɔ tɔma lalu mu-da ʦʰa
\ref Origin.17
\ft She didn't know it, and she gave up on loving a husband, and the days went by, and her spirit dried up (because she was pregnant).
\tx pipi-ja ne tum-ɔ-toʔd-u dʰanɔ pipi-wa tɔpa lalu mu-mu jɔ siʔʦ-a laʔ-a-m-me ɔmnɔ det-to sela det-to pipi-nɔ sagowa haŋ-a ʦʰa
\ref Origin.18
\ft And in her mother's stomach, Nayoma was created.
\tx najoʔma mama-nɔ mumu-go-bi mu tʰiŋ-a ʦʰa
\ref Origin.19
\tx mun-nasi ʦʰa mun-nasi-lɔ ne hawa-nɔ ʦi papa-nɔ sagowa heʔ mama-nɔ sagowa mu-lɔ ne mama ne olʣi-mu-mu lam-u ʦʰa
\ft She was created, and while she grew (in utero), the child of the wind made her mother's spirit like her father's, and tried to make her mother vomit.
\ref Origin.20
\tx ip-di lɔ-di ʦʰa
\ft She felt like sleeping
\ref Origin.21
\tx hjuʔ heʔŋɔ kʰɔre kʰɔre sagowa najoʔma mu-lɔ ne
\ft Nayoma dried her mother's spirit like the wind.
\ref Origin.22
\tx dʰaiʔ mu-to-ŋɔ ɔmnɔ det-to sela det-to ribipma najoʔma waʔ-a
\ft Time passed, and Ribipma gave birth to Nayoma.
\ref Origin.23
\tx waʔ-a waʔ-a-nɔ mama-kɔ minʦuma-ʦi-kɔ mɔ-si ʦʰa
\ft Ribipma gave birth and the mother and girl child were together.

\ft Time passed, and Nayoma came to resemble her mother completely.  Time passed and Nayoma became a young woman.
\ref Origin.25
\tx najoʔma jɔ tɔpa lalu mu-mu lam-u ʦʰa
\ft Najoma too looked for a husband to love.
\ref Origin.26
\tx dʰanɔ tɔpa uma jɔ ja lam-u ebo lam-u mama heʔŋɔ kɔpa jɔ tɔpa lalu a-dʰoʔd-u
\ft She searched here and there for the husband, and like her mother she was not able to find a husband to love anywhere.
\ref Origin.27
\tx dʰaiʔlɔ ne uk malɔ najoʔma jɔ tumtoʔd-u ʦʰa
\ft Then one day, Nayoma too knew (where to look)
\ref Origin.28
\tx dʰailɔ ne mama heʔŋɔ kursi-bi ho-mu-nɔ susula mɔ-ki-lɔ hawa ho-di
\ft And like her mother, when we climb into a walnut tree and whistle, the wind comes.
\ref Origin.29
\tx tɔpa lalu ʦʰoʔ-o det-ka uma jɔ ʦjuʔd-u ʦʰa
\ft It is said that that is how to find a husband to love, and she learned this.
\ref Origin.30
\tx tan-e-n jɔ ma ne kʰuʦ-a ʦʰa-kʰa kursi huŋ-a ʦʰa
\ft After coming down, she went and climbed the walnut tree.
\ref Origin.31
\tx huŋ-a-nɔ susula mu-mu dja-lɔ ne mama tumtoʔd-u ʦʰa
\ft When she climbed and tried to whistle, her mother knew it.
\ref Origin.32
\tx mama hɔ-di-nɔ bʰund-u ʔe laʦi
\ft Her mother arrived and scolded her: "hey, traitor.
\ref Origin.33
\tx an ne pʰjakpa ɔ-ʣupd-una
\ft Your behavior is not good.
\ref Origin.34
\tx umu ne hjuʔ ne a-papa wɔ ma
\ft He is your father, the wind.
\ref Origin.35
\tx asina aŋa tɔpa lalu mu-ŋa-nɔ an ʦʰɔʔ-ɔ-m
\ft A while ago, I loved my husband, and begot you.
\ref Origin.36
\tx hɔʔem ma an jɔ laʦi a-papa-ŋɔ anɔ jɔ tɔpa mu-mu bʰaʔ-na ma luʔ ʦʰa
\ft Well, then? You are a traitor, and your father too, and you are trying to make him your husband!" she said.
\ref Origin.37
\tx dʰailɔ ne najoʔma ne mama-nɔ dʰaʔe-m ŋis-u-m-me laʣi-ja pumd-u ʦʰa pumd-u-lɔ ne kursi-bika tʰja-tanʦ-a ʦʰa
\ft Then after Nayoma heard her mother's words, she felt embarassed, and she fell from the walnut tree.
\ref Origin.38
\tx tʰja-tanʦ-a-nɔ tʰja-tanʦ-a dʰanɔ mama kʰuʦ-akʦ-a ʦʰa
\ft She fell down, and her mother left for good.
\ref Origin.39
\tx aʣi ne mewa kekewa-kɔ ʦuksabjɔksa-wa-nusi-ja dʰiʔ-si ʦʰa dʰanɔ umnusi-ja luʔ-si ʦʰa
\ft Later, after the birds found her, they said to her:
\ref Origin.40
\tx hɔtnɔ pu hɔtnɔ pu ma heʔ ʦʰɔ ma ɔ-mɔ mɔʦi dja-nɔ tumlo kubimɔpa-butu kʰo-si
\ft "How could this be, how did this happen, my niece," they said, and they went up to the shaman.
\ref Origin.41
\tx dʰaiʔlɔ kʰɔiʔ-mu lam-usi a-kʰo-si
\ft And they tried to bring her away, but couldn't.
\ref Origin.42
\tx dʰaiʔlɔ ne kekewa-nɔ lapto-wa pʰind-u-nɔ hjuʔ hɔ-lɔ ne hjuʔ-nɔ sopmu-wa ne najoʔma pʰɔʔ-ɔ tʰinʦa pʰɔʔ-ɔ
\ft Then the bird stretched out its wings and the wind came, and the breath of the wind woke Nayoma, made her regain consciousness.
\ref Origin.43
\tx dʰaiʔlɔ aŋ ne ʦuksabjaksa-nusi haka hetnɔ aŋu nuwa ʦam-a ma
\ft Then (she said) "Helpers, how is it that I lost my mind like this?
\ref Origin.44
\tx hɔtnɔ he ʦʰuk-ʦu ma dja ʦʰa
\ft How is it I became like this?" she said
\ref Origin.45
\tx dʰailɔ ne duku ninambu-lɔm sin-u-nɔ ipʰ-a-ba-m
\ft Then she looked up at the sky, and fell asleep.
\ref Origin.46
\tx dʰaiʔlɔ ne hɔiʔ hɔiʔ lɔ misi ʦʰeld-u-lɔ ne duku ninambu-ʦoptu dʰokʰo ʦʰa
\ft Then somehow, she opened her eyes, and looked up into the sky.
\ref Origin.47

\ft Ruwahang was up in the sky above.
\ref Origin.48
\tx dʰaiʔlɔ ne uma dja ʦʰa lu aŋu tɔpa lalu mu-ŋa-m ho
\ft Then she said: "I loved a husband.
\ref Origin.49
\tx tɔpa lalu-bi kʰɔmd-uŋa-m
\ft I discovered a husband in love.
\ref Origin.50
\tx dʰaiʔlɔ aŋu nam aŋu nuwa rja-di
\ft Then I became dizzy.

\ft Paruhang came there (instead).

\ft After arriving, the birds said:
