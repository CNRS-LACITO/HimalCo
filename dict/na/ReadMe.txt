METAGLOSS:
extensibility in flora and fauna
characteristics of animals in various species
in-place ontology: brook, stream, creek. Set up a local hierarchy: river bigger than... bigger than...

ETYMOLOGICAL GLOSS: for a secondary level of annotation

CALMSEA, SIL, African list, Starostin list for Austronesian, IDS list, extended IDS Intercontinental Dictionary Series, loanword list...

Princeton Chinese Elicitation List, used by ILCAA (3,500 items) Has semantic fields. Contains a lot of useless cultural crap. Problem with the Chinese list.

Extended CALMSEA published at Payap (SIL): 600 words

List of 1,200 words for Austronesian languages

Doug Cooper: tried to do a merger.

Use a standalone
Have a big list as a reference for shorter lists

Numbering? Choice of Doug Cooper: Refer to item number in WordNet. Clearly distinguishes senses. Gives a usage context. And lists all the confusing senses that that word might have. Makes it better than IDS or OWP lists.
Semantic fields? SIL CAWL list. Leaves slots for cultural items.

Target for Doug Cooper: 2,500 words. OK for a list of head words. Larger lists: transparent compounds etc.

Useful technique: set out, on the elicitation list, 2 parallel reference lists: 
(i) proto-forms of the language under study
(ii) local majority/major contact language. Important in Thailand.
