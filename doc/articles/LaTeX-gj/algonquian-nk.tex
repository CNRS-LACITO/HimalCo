\title{From prenasalization to preaspiration in Algonquian}
\author{Guillaume Jacques}
\maketitle
 
 \section{Introduction}
Several Algonquian languages, including Cree and Menominee, present an unusual merger of proto-Algonquian *\ipa{-nC-} and *\ipa{-hC-} clusters as \ipa{-hC-}, implying a sound change from prenasalization to preaspiration, which is unusual and unparalleled in other languages families (see Silverman's \citeyear{silverman03preaspirated} survey of the diachronic origins of preaspirated stops).


Table \ref{tab:nC.PA}, based on Bloomfield's (\citeyear[154-5]{bloomfield25central} / \citeyear{bloomfield46proto}) reconstruction of Proto-Algonquian,\footnote{I adopt Goddard's \citealt{goddard98arapaho} notation of Proto-Algonquian, with *\ipa{r}, *\ipa{rk}, *\ipa{sC} instead of Bloomfield's *\ipa{l}, *\ipa{çk} and *\ipa{xC}. } illustrates the reflexes of proto-Algonquian *\ipa{-nC-} clusters in Ojibwe (where the nasal is preserved), Plains Cree and Menominee. The reflexes of *\ipa{-nC-} in the latter two languages are identical to corresponding *\ipa{-hC-} clusters.
 
 \begin{table}

\end{table}

These correspondences are massively attested and the proto-Algonquian reconstruction is not controversial. The clusters *\ipa{-nr-} and *\ipa{-nθ-} are rare and Table \ref{tab:merger} presents some etymologies illustrating them from Bloomfield and \citet{goddard73nl}.\footnote{Morphological alternations involving these clusters discussed by \citet{goddard73nl} will not be discussed in the present paper, as they predate the sound changes discussed here.}

Despite the rarity of such sound changes, the only explicit attempt at providing an explanation  for them is from \citet[60]{hockett81menominee}, according to whom: `In Menominee and Cree, [...] it seems as though the voicessless of the stop or spirant spread backwards through the nasal; at least, a change from a sequence like \phonet{nt} to \phonet{ht} seems easiest to understand if we think of \phonet{n̥t}.'

This explanation is however very questionable. While there is little doubt that an aspirated nasal \ipa{n̥} can lose its nasality (or transfer it to the following vowel) and merge with \ipa{h} (\citealt{michaud-jacques12nasalite}), all indisputable examples of this change known to us occur in onset position in languages with a phonological contrast between \ipa{n} and \ipa{n̥}, which cannot have been the case in the ancestors of Cree and Menominee.\footnote{Cree and Menominee have undergone these sound changes independently. Menominee, like all Algonquian languages except Plains Algonquian and Cree, merge *\ipa{θ} and *\ipa{r} in all positions,\footnote{Traces of the contrast only remain in palatalized forms of *\ipa{θ}.} a merger that constitutes a common innovation of all these languages (\citealt{goddard94cline}). Thus, any innovative feature exclusively shared by Cree and Menominee can only be either due to contact or parallel innovation.} 

% `as first element of a cluster *n $\rightarrow$ *h'
In this paper, I propose to explain the correspondences in Table \ref{tab:nC.PA} by postulating several pathways of phonetic change, each step of which have parallels in other language families. I account in a different way for the nasal+obstruent clusters on the one hand, and *\ipa{-nr-} on the other hand, for which two competing explanations are proposed.


\section{Nasal+obstruent clusters}
In the case of clusters comprising a homorganic nasal followed by an obstruent (stop/affricate *\ipa{p}, *\ipa{t}, *\ipa{č}, *\ipa{k} or fricative *\ipa{s}, *\ipa{š}) the three stages pathway in (\ref{ex:nC}) can be proposed:

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:nC}
\glt *\ipa{-nC-} $\rightarrow$ \ipa{-CC-} $\rightarrow$ \ipa{-ʰCC-} $\rightarrow$ \ipa{-hC-} 
\end{exe}

First, the cluster *\ipa{-nC-} changes to a geminate consonant, a sound change cross-linguistically well-attested (for instance in Hebrew, see \citealt[71-75]{jouon06}).

Second, the geminated consonants develop phonetic preaspiration, a phenomenon attested for instance in the Kiranti language   Khaling, where geminated stops and double stop clusters preceded by short vowels are automatically preaspirated (\citealt[44]{jacques16tonogenesis}).

Third, the preaspiration, originally a secondary cue of gemination, becomes the main phonetic cue of the contrast (\citealt[172]{kuemmel07wandel}, \citealt{silverman03preaspirated}), and geminated consonants merge with the corresponding preaspirated ones.
  
  
 \section{*-nr-}
The hypothesis proposed for n+obstruents cannot account for the merger of Proto-Algonquian *\ipa{-nr-} and *\ipa{-hr-} clusters as *\ipa{-hr-} in pre-Cree and pre-Menominee and their subsequent evolution to \ipa{-hy-} and \ipa{-hn-} respectively. That these sound changes are independent is confirmed by the fact that the Eastern Algonquian languages Unami and Munsee languages have undergone *\ipa{-nr-} / *\ipa{-nθ-} $\rightarrow$ \ipa{-hl-} but have preserved the nasal before stops (\citealt[25]{goddard82munsee}).\footnote{In addition, in Unami and Munsee *\ipa{hr} becomes \ipa{x} and does not merge with the reflex of *\ipa{nr}.}

I propose here two alternative hypotheses to account for the change of prenasalization to preaspiration in these clusters in Cree, Menominee and Munsee. Both involve an intermediate stage with an unvoiced *\ipa{r̥} merging into pre-aspirated *\ipa{hr}.

\subsection{The Welsh model}
In Welsh, proto-Celtic *\ipa{r} becomes aspirated \ipa{rh} in fortis position, ie. word-initially  and word-internally after nasal (\citealt[145]{kuemmel07wandel}, \citealt[471-480]{jackson56early}), as illustrated by XXX

I propose a similar sound change as a possibility to account for the merger of *\ipa{-hr-} and *\ipa{-nr-} in Cree, Menominee and Munsee.

First, as indicated in \ref{ex:nr1}, *\ipa{r} (including, in the case of Menominee and Unami/Munsee, *\ipa{r} from *\ipa{-θ-}) developed an unvoiced allophone *\ipa{r̥} word-initially and after nasal.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:nr1}
\glt *\ipa{-nr-} $\rightarrow$ *\ipa{-nr̥-} $\rightarrow$ *\ipa{-r̥-} $\rightarrow$ *\ipa{-hr-} 
\end{exe}

Second, nasality was lost before *\ipa{-r̥-}, which merged with the cluster *\ipa{-hr-} in intervocalic position. In word-initial position, allophony was lost and *\ipa{-r-} became revoiced, a common phenomenon with voiceless sonorants (see \citealt{blevins16voiceless.sonorants}).

\subsection{The Gemination model}
While in Hebrew, the sound law *-nC- $\rightarrow$ -CC- does not apply to \ipa{r}, this sound change is attested in many languages, including Latin (\citet[213]{leumann77lateinische}, in examples such as \ipa{irrigāre} `irrigate' < *\ipa{in-rigāre}). Another possible pathway to explain the development of preaspiration from prenasalization is presented in (\ref{ex:nr2}):

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:nr2}
\glt *\ipa{-nr-} $\rightarrow$ *\ipa{-rr-} $\rightarrow$ *\ipa{-r̥-} $\rightarrow$ \ipa{-hr-} 
\end{exe}

In this hypothesis, *\ipa{r} undergoes the sound change *-nC- $\rightarrow$ *-CC- like obstruents. Geminated *\ipa{-rr-} then becomes unvoiced *\ipa{-r̥-} and eventually merges with *\ipa{-hr-}.
