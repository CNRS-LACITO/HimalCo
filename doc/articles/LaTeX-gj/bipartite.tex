 \section*{Introduction}
Bipartite verbs, though common in some areas of the world (\citealt{delancey96bipartite}), are relatively rare in Eurasia. In the Trans-Himalayan family, bipartite verbs are found in Kiranti and Gyalrongic, and present another uncommon typological characteristic, 
multiple argument indexation (\citealt{denk15multiple}).

This paper presents the first description of bipartite verbs in Gyalrongic, and show how the genesis of this relatively recent construction sheds light on how bipartite verbs were independently grammaticalized in Kiranti.



\section{Bipartite verbs in Japhug} \label{sec:japhug.bipart}

Bipartite verbs in Japhug and other Gyalrong languages are a small class (only ten such verbs have been discovered up to now). 
The most common bipartite verb, \jpg{stu=mbat}{try hard, do one's best (\zh{努力})} can be conjugated in four distinct ways. Table \ref{tab:four} illustrates these four options with the imperative second dual form `try hard (the two of you)'.


\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Four degrees of integration} \centering \label{tab:four}
\begin{tabular}{lllllll}
\toprule
Type & Example & V_1 suffix & V_2 prefix \\
\midrule
A (quasi-SVC) & \ipa{tɤ-stu-ndʑi} \ipa{tɤ-mbat-ndʑi} &\Y &\Y \\
 &\textsc{imp}-V_1-\textsc{du}  \textsc{imp}-V_2-\textsc{du} \\
B (right-dominant) & \ipa{tɤ-stu=tɤ-mbat-ndʑi} &\N  &\Y \\
 &\textsc{imp}-V_1-\textsc{imp}-V_2-\textsc{du} \\
C (left-dominant) & \ipa{tɤ-stu-ndʑi=mbat-ndʑi} &\Y  &\N \\
 &\textsc{imp}-V_1-\textsc{du}-V_2-\textsc{du} \\
D (quasi-compound)& \ipa{tɤ-stu-mbat-ndʑi} &\N  &\N \\
 &\textsc{imp}-V_1-V_2-\textsc{du} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In type A forms, the two verb stems are not phonologically integrated, and each of them takes both prefixes and suffixes. This form is a type of lexicalized serial verb construction (cf section \ref{sec:serial}). Note that as unlike normal serial verb constructions, insertion of linkers between the two verbs is not attested in the corpus. However, with \jpg{fse=raŋ}{happen so many things}, it is possible to repeat the subject, as in example \refb{ex:fse.rang}.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:fse.rang}
\gll 
\ipa{nɯra} \ipa{pɯ-fse}, \ipa{nɯra} \ipa{pɯ-raŋ} \\
\textsc{dem:pl} \textsc{pst.ipfv}-be.like \textsc{dem:pl} \textsc{pst.ipfv}-last.a.long.time \\ 
\glt `All these things happened.' (many attestations of this sentence, occurs in traditional stories typically to avoid repeating sentences when a characters tells another character what has happened previously)
\end{exe}

In type B and C forms, the two conjugated verb forms merge phonologically, and either the suffixe(s) of the first verb (in the case of the right-dominant B type, where the V_1 has a reduced form and the V_2 the full form) or the prefixe(s) of the second one (left-dominant) are removed. Prefixal or suffixal chains are either preserved or completely removed; it is not possible to have intermediate forms. For instance, the type B form in example \refb{ex:atAtWstu} cannot be changed to something like $\dagger$\ipa{a-tɤ-tɯ-stu=tɯ-mbat-ndʑi} with only the second person \ipa{tɯ-} prefix without the irrealis prefixes.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:atAtWstu}
\gll \ipa{a-tɤ-tɯ-stu=a-tɤ-tɯ-mbat-ndʑi} \\
\textsc{irr-pfv-2}-try.hard(1)=\textsc{irr-pfv-2}-try.hard(2)-\textsc{du} \\
\glt `(while I am gone),  may the two of you do your best.' (Smanmi0, 56)
\end{exe}

In type D forms, the two verbs come to share the same prefixal and suffixal chain, with no intervening affix between the two verb stems.

Table \ref{tab:bipartite} summarizes all bipartite verbs discovered up to now in Japhug. Note the important proportion of Tibetan loanwords (\ipa{=raŋ}, \ipa{zdɯɣ=sŋɤl}, \ipa{ntsʰɤβ=}, \ipa{rga=}, respectively from \ipa{riŋ}, \ipa{sdug.bsŋal}, \ipa{ⁿtsʰab}, \ipa{dga}).

The stative bipartite verbs \ipa{zdɯɣ=sŋɤl}, \ipa{rga=le} and \ipa{rga=χi} are attested in A form only in non-finite form. 

It is difficult to apply the rich array of voice derivations available in Japhug to bipartite verbs. The only unproblematic derivation I could elicit is the tropative\footnote{Tropative is a voice deriving a transitive verb meaning `find, consider X to be Y' from a stative verb Y, see \citet{jacques13tropative}.} verb \jpg{nɤ-stu-mbat}{consider that X tries hard}, which is derived from the type D form.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

There is only one bipartite transitive verb, \ipa{spa=rka}, which is actually even tripartite, since its always occur with an existential verb -- it means `be guilty' when used with the positive existential verb \jpg{tu}{exist} and  `be innocent' with the negative one \jpg{me}{not exist} (which cannot take person/number indexation in this construction). Although morphologically transitive (see for instance the presence of stem III \ipa{a} $\rightarrow$ \ipa{e} alternation in \textsc{sg}$\rightarrow$3 non-past forms, in examples \ref{ex:mAspea} to \ref{ex:mAtWspe2}), this verb has an expletive object which cannot be overt. Examples \refb{ex:mAspea} and \refb{ex:mAspea} illustrate the A form, and \refb{ex:mAtWsparkandZi} and \refb{ex:mAtWspe2} the D form. Note than even though the suffixes of the V_1 cannot be realized in D-form, stem III alternation (marking singular A) still appears.

\begin{exe}

\gll \ipa{mɤ-spe-a} \ipa{mɤ-rke-a} \ipa{me} \\
\textsc{neg}-be.innocent(1)[III]:\textsc{fact}-\textsc{1sg} \textsc{neg}-be.innocent(2)[III]:\textsc{fact}-\textsc{1sg} not.exist:\textsc{fact} \\

\glt `You_{sg} are innocent.'
\end{exe} 

\section{Compound verbs in Japhug} \label{sec:compounds}
Apart from bipartite verbs, we find in Japhug another class of verbs combining two verb roots into one lexeme: compound verbs.

Unlike bipartite verbs,  compound verbs do not allow multiple indexation (such as inflectional morphemes intervening between the two roots) and the first member of the compound undergoes \textit{status constructus} vowel change (see  \citealt[1215]{jacques12incorp}, \ipa{a/u} $\rightarrow$ \ipa{ɤ} in examples 1 and 4 below). In addition, an additional derivational prefix is often present (\ipa{a-} and \ipa{rɤ-/a-} in examples 1, 2 and 3 below).

\begin{enumerate}
\item \jpg{pa}{do} + \jpg{mbat}{be easy} $\Rightarrow$ \jpg{a-pɤ-mbat}{easy to do}
\item \jpg{χtɯ}{buy} + \jpg{ntsɣe}{sell} $\Rightarrow$ \jpg{ra-χtɯ-tsɣe}{do commerce (\zh{做买卖})} 
\item \jpg{joʁ}{raise} + \jpg{βzɯr}{move}   $\Rightarrow$  \jpg{rɤ-joʁ-βzɯr}{tidy up}
\item \jpg{ngu}{feed} + \jpg{jtsʰi}{give to drink} $\Rightarrow$ \jpg{ngɤ-jtsʰi}{feed}
\end{enumerate}

The first three examples are actually historically denominal verbs, derived from action noun compounds made of two verb roots, in a way similar to incorporating verbs, which originate from the denominal derivation of noun-verb compounds (\citealt{jacques12incorp}). The noun compound \jpg{joʁ-βzɯr}{tidying up} from which \jpg{rɤ-joʁ-βzɯr}{tidy up} is derived is still attested, and can be used in a light verb construction:

\begin{exe}
\ex 
 \gll \ipa{joʁβzɯr} \ipa{tɤ-βzu-t-a} \\
 tidying.up \textsc{pfv}-do-\textsc{pst:tr-1sg} \\
 \glt `I did some tidying up.'
\end{exe}

The other action nominal *\ipa{pɤ-mbat} `action that is easy to do' and ?\ipa{χtɯ-tsɣe} `commerce' have not been recorded, but it is unproblematic to assume that they used to exist and that the corresponding verbs derive from them.

Note the antipassive-like value of the derivation in examples 2 and 3, where the compound verb derived from two transitive verbs is intransitive. Note that the denominal prefix \ipa{rɤ-} is the same from which the antipassive derivation was grammaticalized (see  \citealt{jacques14antipassive}).

Example 4 \jpg{ngɤ-jtsʰi}{feed} differs from the preceding one by having no denominal prefix. Such compound verbs are a minority (only four are attested, see Table \ref{tab:compound.verbs}), but all start in a cluster whose first element is a nasal. It is thus possible that a reduced form of the denominal prefix (as in \jpg{ngo}{be sick} from denominal \ipa{n(ɯ)}+\jpg{--ŋgo}{disease}) has been absorbed by the verb stem.\footnote{For examples of such a development in Khroskyabs, see \citet{jacques12incorp} and \citealt{lai13affixale}. } Nevertheless, since some of these compound verbs do not have visible \textit{status constructus} alternation (since for instance \ipa{ɯ} does not alternate), some of them are not synchronically distinguishable from type D bipartite verbs.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

Most compound verbs in Japhug are \textit{dvandva}-like (`do $V_1$ and $V_2$')  but in a few examples, like \jpg{a-pɤ-mbat}{easy to do} or \jpg{nɯ-ndzɤ-mbɣom}{be in a hurry to eat}, the semantic relationship between $V_1$  and $V_2$ is the same as that of a main verb and its complement (`$V_2$ to $V_1$').

The verb \jpg{a-rgɤ-le}{be extremely happy} is related to the bipartite verb \ipa{rga=le} mentioned in Table \ref{tab:bipartite}, showing that bipartite verbs too can be converted into compound verb verbs by means of denominal derivation.

\section{Serial verb constructions in Japhug} \label{sec:serial}
The A form of bipartite verbs is formally similar to serial verb constructions (\citealt{sun12complementation, jacques13harmonization}). In these constructions, both verbs share the same arguments, transitivity, TAM, polarity and associated motion markers. Unlike serial constructions in other languages, various linkers and emphatic markers are possible between the two verbs (examples \ref{ex:totChW2} and \ref{ex:kuWGstuanW}).

Serial verb constructions mainly occur with deideophonic verbs (example \ref{ex:totChW2}) and action deixis verbs (transitive \ref{ex:kuWGstuanW} or intransitive \ref{ex:ki.fsea}).

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:totChW2}
\gll 	\ipa{srɯnmɯ} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{to-nɯdrɯβ} 	\ipa{ʑo} 	 	\ipa{to-tɕʰɯ} \\
 râkshasî \textsc{dem}  \textsc{ifr}-repeatedly.gore  \textsc{emph}  \textsc{ifr}-gore \\
 \glt `(The rhinoceros) gored the râkshasî repeatedly and killed her.' 
\end{exe}	

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:kuWGstuanW}
\gll 	
 \ipa{aʑo} 	\ipa{kɯki} 	\ipa{ntsɯ} 	\ipa{kú-wɣ-stu-a-nɯ} 	\ipa{tɕe,} 	\ipa{kú-wɣ-znɯkʰrɯm-a-nɯ} \\
 \textsc{1sg} \textsc{dem:prox} always \textsc{ipfv-inv}-do.like-\textsc{1sg-pl} \textsc{lnk} \textsc{ipfv-inv}-punish-\textsc{1sg-pl} \\
 \glt `They punished me like this.' (Gesar, 278)
\end{exe}	

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:ki.fsea}
\gll \ipa{aʑo} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{sŋiɕɤr} 	\ipa{ʑo} 	\ipa{kutɕu} 	\ipa{ki} 	\ipa{fse-a} 	\ipa{ndzur-a} 	\ipa{ntsɯ} 	\ipa{ɲɯ-ra} 	\ipa{tɕe,} \\
\textsc{1sg} \textsc{dem} night.and.day \textsc{emph} here \textsc{dem:prox} be.like:\textsc{fact-1sg} stand:\textsc{fact-1sg} always \textsc{sens}-have.to like \\
\glt `I have to stand like this night and day.' (The divination, 2002, 44)
\end{exe}

It is very likely that bipartite verbs originate from serial verb constructions,\footnote{Note that for instance associated motion prefixes are likely to have originated in a serial verb construction too (see \citealt{jacques13harmonization}).} especially since in the case of \jpg{mu=cɯɣ}{be  terrified}, \jpg{ntsʰɤβ=rlu}{in a hurry}, \jpg{kʰrɯ=jɤβ}{be extremely dry}, \jpg{rga=le}{be extremely happy} and \jpg{rga=χi}{be extremely happy}, the V_2 is clearly ideophonic-like. 

The only other possible construction from which bipartite verb could have originated are finite complements, as in example \ref{ex:tundzxi}.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:tundzxi}
\gll 
\ipa{tɤjpa} 	\ipa{kɯ-xtɕɯ\tld{}xtɕi} 	\ipa{ka-lɤt} 	\ipa{ri,} 	\ipa{mɯ́j-ʁdɯɣ,} 	\ipa{pɤjkʰu} 	\ipa{tu-ndʐi} 	\ipa{ɲɯ-cʰa} \\
snow \textsc{inf:stat-emph}\tld{}be.small \textsc{pfv}:3$\rightarrow$3'-throw but \textsc{neg:sens}-be.serious still \textsc{ipfv}-melt \textsc{sens}-can \\
\glt `There was a little snow, but it doesn't matter, it can still melt.' (conversation, 2015/12/17)
\end{exe}

However, none of V_2 of bipartite verbs in Japhug are complement taking verbs, so that such hypothesis is highly unlikely. 

\section{The genesis of bipartite verbs}
Bipartite verbs in Japhug are a marginal class, still barely grammaticalized from a serial verb construction, and may thus provide a useful model to understand how bipartite verbs in other languages came into being. 

Figure \ref{fig:bipartite.pathways} presents a summary of all pathways suggested in this paper to account for the origin of bipartite verbs.

Most bipartite verbs originate from lexicalized serial verb constructions. The origin of these serial constructions is an issue in itself which is not discussed in the present paper, but either parataxis or finite complements (see example \ref{ex:tundzxi} above) are conceivable sources.

\end{figure}

In type A bipartite verbs, the two verbs, though still phonologically two distinct words, are more closely attached to one another than in common serial verb constructions: insertion of linkers is difficult, and the relative order of the two verbs cannot be changed.

Type B and C are intermediate stages from the quasi-serial verb construction (type A) to the quasi-verb compounds (type D). Rather than directly fusing into a phonological word, the two verbs first share either their suffixes or their prefixes; note that the first option is by far the most common. Type C is only attested with the verb \jpg{stu=mbat}{try hard, do one's best}.

Type D verbs are almost identical to compound verbs; the only differences are (a)  absence of \textit{status constructus} vowel alternation on the V_1 (b) presence of stem alternation on the V_1 (c) absence of denominal derivation prefix. Since (a) and (c) are also found on some compound verbs, and since (b) only applies to transitive verbs, some verbs can actually be synchronically analyzed as either bipartite or compound verb.

Thus, in a language whose bipartite verbs are more ancient, and whose grammaticalization process is less transparent than in Japhug, several competing pathways should be postulated and taken as possibilities.

\section{Bipartite verbs in Kiranti} \label{sec:kiranti.bipart}

\subsection{Bipartite verbs and prefix ordering}
Kiranti languages are well-known for having a class of complex predicates combining a lexical verb with an auxiliary, which share some of their person indexation and TAM markers. Example (\ref{ex:ityodzyoyi}) from Khaling shows the verb root \dhatu{tA}{put}\footnote{See \citet{jacques12khaling} for an account of stem alternations in Khaling.} combined with the auxiliary \dhatu{-dzA}{keep on} grammaticalized from the verb \dhatu{dzA}{eat}. The verb and the auxiliary share the second person prefix \ipa{ʔi-}, but the suffixes remain distinct: the auxiliary receives the full form of the suffix \ipa{-ji}, while the lexical verb has a reduced form \ipa{-j-}: dual number is thus redundantly indexed two times in this form.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:ityodzyoyi}
\gll \ipa{ʔi-tɵ-j-dzɵ-ji}\\
2/\textsc{inv}-put-\textsc{du.incl}-keep.on-\textsc{du.incl} \\
\glt You_{du} keep on putting it.
\end{exe}

This form is intermediate between types C and D: both verb stems share the same prefixal slot, but the first verb has a phonologically reduced suffixal slot, which cannot be a distinct syllable.

In other Kiranti languages such as Bantawa, bipartite verbs are phonologically less closely integrated. As in Khaling, prefixes only appear once in the bipartite verb; some suffixes are obligatorily redundantly replicated in bipartite verb forms, such as the 1/2 plural \ipa{-in}, while other ones such as the exclusive \ipa{-ka} are not, as illustrated by \refb{ex:kharin}. 

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:timannin}
\gll
\ipa{tɨ-man-nin} \ipa{kʰan-nin} \\
2-lose-\textsc{1ns$\leftrightarrow$2} send.away-\textsc{1ns$\leftrightarrow$2} \\
\glt ‘You_s have forgotten us_{pe}’ (\citealt[168]{doornenbal09})
\end{exe}

 \begin{exe}
\ex  \label{ex:kharin}
\gll \ipa{kʰar-in} \ipa{lont-in-ka} \\
go-\textsc{1/2pl} come.out-\textsc{1/2pl-excl} \\
\glt `We shall rise again.' (\citealt[254]{doornenbal09})
\end{exe}

We see that bipartite verbs in Bantawa differs from Japhug type C in that only \textit{part} of the suffixal chain is replicated. Interestingly, while we find several type-C-like bipartite verbs in Kiranti, examples of type-B are not attested as far as I have been able to ascertain from the available data.

The Japhug model may also help to historically interpret the origin of \textit{variable prefix ordering}  in Kiranti languages such as Chintang (\citealt{bickel07chintang}) and Bantawa (\citealt[170-172]{doornenbal09}), as illustrated by the following examples :

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:ukosagonde}
\gll \ipa{u-kos-a-gond-e} \\

Such affix variability has no equivalent in Japhug (and is not found everywhere even in Kiranti; for instance Khaling has a fixed verbal template). To explain the variable placement of the \ipa{u-} person prefix, I propose that Chintang has undergone  fusion from a serial verb construction such as \refb{ex:pchintang};\footnote{This is a schematic representation of the structure of the proto-form; a real reconstruction is not yet possible at this stage of our knowledge of Kiranti historical morphology; in particular, I make no attempt to explain the origin of the \ipa{a/e} alternation of the \textsc{pst} suffix. } at that stage, what became later the ambulative suffix was still a motion verb, inflected like a normal intransitive verb.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:pchintang}
\gll *\ipa{u-kos-e} \ipa{u-gond-e} \\
\textsc{3ns.S/A}-walk-\textsc{pst} \textsc{3ns.S/A}-walk.around-\textsc{pst} \\
\end{exe}


The integration of the two verb forms into a bipartite verb, following the general pattern in Kiranti, results in only one of the prefixes being kept in the fused form. In example \ref{ex:ukosagonde}, it is the prefix of the V_2 that is lost, as in the type C conjugation found in Japhug. However, Chintang (and Bantawa), unlike Japhug, had the option of preserving the prefix of the V_2 (trapped between the two verb stems) rather than that of the V_1, resulting in form \ref{ex:kosaugonde}; I will refer to such forms as C'.

Note that it is not possible to account for C' forms as being grammaticalized from the fusion of a non-finite verb form with a fully conjugated light verb, since the V_1 still keeps part of the TAM suffixes and person indexes.

%Given the intricate complexity of variable prefix ordering in Chintang and Bantawa, this hypothesis needs to be tested against the whole corpus of verb forms in these languages, but this research goes beyond the topic of the present paper.


\subsection{The past tense prefix} \label{sec:pst}
A TAM suffix originating from a form *\ipa{-tV-} is found in various Kiranti languages, including including Western Kiranti (Thulung, \citealt{lahaussois03}), North-East Kiranti (Khaling, Dumi and Koyi, cf \citealt{driem93dumi, lahaussois09, jacques12khaling}), Southern Kiranti (Bantawa, \citealt{doornenbal09}) and Eastern Kiranti (Belhare, \citealt[551]{bickel03belhare}).

It marks past tense in most languages, but is used for the non-past in Dumi, Koyi and Belhare, a puzzling fact that has remained unexplained.

In most Kiranti languages, in particular Dumi and Khaling, the \ipa{-t-} suffix has a fixed place in the verbal template. 

However, in Bantawa we observe that the second person prefix has variable placement and can occur either before the verb stem, or between the verb stem and the past tense suffix (\citealt[171]{doornenbal09}).

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:timankhatda}
\gll 
\ipa{tɨ-man-kʰat-da} \\
2-\textsc{neg}-go-\textsc{pst} \\
\ex
\gll 
\ipa{man-tɨ-kʰat-da} \\
\textsc{neg}-2-go-\textsc{pst} \\
\ex 
\gll 
\ipa{man-kʰat-tɨ-da} \\
\textsc{neg}-go-2-\textsc{pst} \\
\glt `You did not go.'
\end{exe}

In view of the previous discussion, this suggest that the past suffix originates from a V_2 in a serial construction, and that a type A proto-form such as *\ipa{tə-kʰat=tə-ta} `He went'\footnote{Bantawa \ipa{d} comes from proto-Kiranti *\ipa{t} in stressed syllables (\citealt{michailovsky94stops}); this sound law does not apply to prefixes (\citealt{jacques12agreement}).} either changed to type C *\ipa{tə-kʰat-ta} or to type C' *\ipa{kʰat-tə-ta}, from which in turn the attested Bantawa verb forms directly originate. Indeed, \citet[165;272]{doornenbal09} treats the past tense suffix as derived from the verb \dhatu{da} `effect, do, finalize'.

Even in Khaling and Dumi, where affix order is more rigid, we find  and additional clue that the TAM suffix comes from a V_2: person indexation is redundantly indicated after the the \ipa{-t-} suffix, as illustrated by the following examples:

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:dzungta}
\gll \ipa{dzû-ŋ-t-ʌ} \\
eat:\textsc{1sg}$\rightarrow$3-\textsc{1sg-pst-1sg} \\
\glt `I ate it'
\ex \label{ex:dzyoiti}
\gll \ipa{dzɵ̂-j-t-i} \\
eat-\textsc{du-pst-du} \\
\glt `We_{di}/They_d ate it'
\ex \label{ex:dzyoktiki}
\gll \ipa{dzɵ-k-t-iki} \\
eat-\textsc{1p-pst-1pi} \\
\glt `We_{pi} ate it'
\ex \label{ex:dzyutya}
\gll \ipa{dzʉ-t-ɛ} \\
eat:\textsc{2/3sg$\rightarrow$3}-\textsc{pst-2/3} \\
\glt `He ate it'
\end{exe}

The reduced person suffix found in \refb{ex:dzyoiti} and \refb{ex:dzyoktiki} between the verb stem and the past tense suffix is exactly the same as that found in complex predicates (compare with \refb{ex:ityodzyoyi} above). 

The hypothesis that the TAM suffix *\ipa{-t-} did originate from a V_2 is further supported by the existence of a verb root which could be the source of this suffix:the verb *\ipa{ta}, whose original meaning must have been `put' (Khaling \dhatu{tA}{put}, Limbu \dhatu{tha}{put away})\footnote{Cognates of this root are found elsewhere in the Trans-Himalayan family, e.g. Japhug \ipa{ta} `put'.}.  In Khaling, the forms of the person indexation suffix  following \ipa{-t-} partially resemble, but are not identical to, the non-past forms of the verb \dhatu{ta}{put}, as shown in Table \ref{tab:tANA}; the first person past suffix \ipa{-tʌ} is identical to the stem of the \textsc{1sg$\rightarrow$3}  \ipa{tʌ-ŋʌ} `I put it' without the suffix \ipa{-ŋʌ}, and the third/second person singular suffix \ipa{-tɛ} is identical to the stem of the and \textsc{1sg$\rightarrow$3} \textsc{3sg$\rightarrow$3}  \ipa{tɛ} `he puts it'. The first person dual and plural forms cannot be straightforwardly explained at this stage; one possibility is that \ipa{-ti} is the phonetic outcome of proto-Kiranti *\ipa{ta-si} (the probably original form of the \textsc{1di}, see \citealt[58]{jacques16tonogenesis}), while the \textsc{1di} of  put' \ipa{tɵ-ji} was remade by analogy with forms such as the infinitive \ipa{tɵ-nɛ}.

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Non-Past paradigm of the verb \dhatu{ta}{put} in Khaling and corresponding suffixes in the Past paradigms} \centering \label{tab:tANA}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\toprule
S/A & \dhatu{ta}{put} & Past Suffix + Person Indexation Suffix \\
\midrule
\textsc{1sg} & \ipa{tʌ-ŋʌ} &  \ipa{-tʌ}  \\
\textsc{1di} & \ipa{tɵ-ji} &  \ipa{-ti}  \\
\textsc{1pi} & \ipa{tɵ-ki} & \ipa{-tiki}  \\

\textsc{3sg} & \ipa{tɛ} & \ipa{-tɛ}  \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


The development from a verb `put' to completive aspect is amply attested (\citealt[58]{bybee94TAM}, \citealt[248]{heine-kuteva02}) and could account from the grammaticalization of this verb as a past tense marker. Another possibility (suggested to me by Scott DeLancey), is that `put' was first grammaticalized as a perfect marker, from which it became non-past in some languages (Dumi, Koyi) and past in other ones, while the unmarked verb form became specialized for the opposite category (past vs non-past respectively).

Given the wide distribution of this suffix, appearing in all identified subgroups of Kiranti, its absence in some languages (such as Limbu, \citealt{driem87}) is better explained by the hypothesis that they lost it rather than never developped it. If true, this also implies that other V_2, which were grammaticalized \textit{after} the TAM suffix *\ipa{-t}, were grammaticalized independently in Western and Eastern Kiranti languages, and that they should not be reconstructed to proto-Kiranti despite their surface resemblance.

\section*{Conclusion}
This paper shows how bipartite verbs have been grammaticalized from Serial Verb constructions in both Gyalrongic and Kiranti. 

In Japhug (Gyalrongic), the nascent bipartite verbs are historically transparent. Comparison with  Kiranti, while revealing interesting differences, also shed a new light on the grammaticalization process of bipartite verbs in both groups. The free prefix ordering attested in languages such as Chintang and Bantawa (\citealt{bickel07chintang}) is argued to be one of the indirect traces of this grammaticalization pathway from SVC. In addition, among the earliest V_2 grammaticalized as a suffix in Kiranti, we find the verb `to put', which became a TAM suffix and is still preserved in most Kiranti languages.
