\subsection{Applicative \forme{-t}}
Beside the productive prefixal \forme{nɯ-} applicative (sec XXX), Japhug has vestigial traces of a \forme{-t} applicative suffix, better attested in Kiranti and West Himalayish languages (see \citealt{michailovsky85dental} and \citealt{jacques16ssuffixes} for comparative studies of this suffix). Only two examples of this derivation exist: \japhug{ɣɯt}{bring} and \japhug{mdɯt}{strongly desire}

The verb of manipulation \japhug{ɣɯt}{bring} derives from the motion verb \japhug{ɣi}{come}
