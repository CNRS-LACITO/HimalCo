\chapter*{Introduction}  
This draft is the first part of a grammar of Japhug. The examples are mainly based on a text corpus partially available on the Pangloss Archive (\url{http://lacito.vjf.cnrs.fr/pangloss/corpus/list\_rsc.php?lg=Japhug}, though additional examples from casual conversations and elicitations are also included.
