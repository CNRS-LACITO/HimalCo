\title{The Sino-Tibetan origins of the Middle Chinese voicing alternation}
\author{Guillaume Jacques}
\maketitle


%Abstract: Among the traces of morphology that remain in Middle Chinese, one of the clearest one is the transivity-related voicing alternation (\citealt[79-80]{zhou62goucibian}, \citealt{downer73loanwords}, \citealt{sagart03prenasalized}), exemplified by verbs such as \zhc{敗}{pæjH} `defeat' and \zhc{敗}{bæjH} `be defeated'. Consensus does not yet exist on the proto-Trans-Himalayan origins of this alternation (\citealt{handel12valence}): according to the view of some scholars (for instance \citealt{mei12caus}) the intransitive voiced verb is the base form, and the transitive one is its causative (with a sigmatic causative prefix devoicing the initial), while other scholars (\citealt{sagart12sprefix}) argue that this alternation is unrelated to the causative prefix, and that the base form is the transitive verb instead.
%
%In this paper, drawing on data from more conservative and morphologically complex languages of the family such as Gyalrongic (in particular \citealt{jacques15causative, lai16caus, gong17xingtaixue}), Jinghpo and Tibetan, I show that the first view is untenable, but that the second view must be slightly revised: the voicing alternation in Old Chinese reflects the merger of the ancient anticausative derivation (which appears as prenasalization in Gyalrongic, and may be related to the autobenefactive/spontaneous prefix, see  \citealt{jacques15spontaneous}) and the passive \ipa{*ŋa-} derivation (\citealt{jacques07passif, jacques12demotion}), the latter explaining cases like \zhc{現}{ɣenH} `to appear' which make no sense as anticausatives.
%
%Following on  \citet{jacques16ssuffixes}, this paper suggests that the apparently rudimentary state of Old Chinese morphology is in fact an illusion due to the massive phonological mergers that took place, and obscured the nature of morphological alternations.  

 \section*{Introduction}
 \section{The voicing alternation in Old Chinese}
Consensus does not yet exist on the proto-Trans-Himalayan origins of this alternation (\citealt{handel12valence}): according to the view of some scholars (for instance \citealt{mei12caus}) the intransitive voiced verb is the base form, and the transitive one is its causative (with a sigmatic causative prefix devoicing the initial), while other scholars (\citealt{sagart12sprefix}) argue that this alternation is unrelated to the causative prefix, and that the base form is the transitive verb instead.
 
 
 In the following, I review several proposed functions of the voicing alternation in Old Chinese.
 
 \subsection{Transitivity alternation} \label{sec:oc.anticausative}
 The most discussed function of the voicing alternation in Old Chinese is the case of verb pairs, in which the unvoiced counterpart is transitive, and the voiced one intransitive. Table \ref{tab:voicing.transitivity} presents examples from several sources (\citealt[79-80; 86]{zhou62goucibian}, \citealt{downer73loanwords}, \citealt{sagart03prenasalized}). \citet[86]{zhou62goucibian} analyzes some of these examples as \zh{既事式}  `perfect', by which is presumably implied a resultative meaning.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

 \citet{downer73loanwords} and \citet{sagart03prenasalized} point out in addition the existence of 
a few verb pairs with voicing in Mien loanwords from Chinese, in particular:\footnote{All Mien forms in the paper are taken from Mao Zongwu's \citeyear{maozw92mien} dictionary, with page number and original gloss.} 

\begin{enumerate}
\item \mien{khoːi}{1}{open (tr)}{打开}{131}  vs \mien{goːi}{1}{open (it)}{开}{131}  (Mao Zongwu notes `\zh{多作补语或自然开裂、开放}')
\item \mien{tshɛʔ}{7}{pull down (house)}{拆}{120} vs \mien{dzɛʔ}{7}{be cracked (of earth, of skin)}{拆开；皴}{151}
\end{enumerate}

Prenasalization in Mien is uncontroversially reconstructed as prenasalization (\citealt{ratliff10protohm}), and voiced obstruents with the low register tones (1, 3, 5, 7) originate from nasal+unvoiced stop or nasal+unvoiced aspirated stop in pre-Mien, and these Mien examples support the idea that the intransitive counterpart derives from the transitive one by addition of a nasal element. These two examples are also interesting in showing prenasalization with verbs that has aspirated unvoiced initials in Chinese; note that none of the example in Table \ref{tab:voicing.transitivity} has an aspirated initial, a fact which \citet{sagart03prenasalized} interprets as resulting from a sound change whereby prenasalization is lost in MC in the case of aspirated stops.

Transitivity alternations in Chinese loanwords in Mien between unvoiced unaspirated stops and voiced stops are also found, as shown by \mien{pɛːŋ}{1}{to stretch tight, to pull tight}{绷；拉紧；拔}{120} vs \mien{bɛːŋ}{1}{to crack}{裂开}{150-1}, a fact expected in the theory that the intransitive form derives from the transitive one, but unexplainable in the alternative theory. In section \ref{sec:anticausative.passive}, we will see that this idea is supported by data from more conservative languages of the TH family.

\subsection{Volitional}
\citet[55;131-5]{bs14oc} have proposed that the voice alternation in OC also had the function of deriving a volitional verb from a non-volitional one, on the basis of the example in Table \ref{ex:voice.volition}, which include some pairs with voiced aspirates in Min.\footnote{Some scholars, such as \citet{handel10min}, do not agree that the series reconstructed as voiced aspirates in proto-Min directly reflect an Old Chinese category, but the fact that these alternations appear to have a morphological function in Min is not compatible with the assumption that this category results from dialect mixture.  }

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Voicing alternation and transitivity/volition?} \label{ex:voice.volition}
\begin{tabular}{llllllllll}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This list is highly heterogenous; it mainly includes  pairs of verb with a transitivity alternation (the transitive counterpart having a voiced initial), and it is not obvious that the alternation has anything to do with volition: there is no pair of verb with the same argument structure, and a purely volitional/non-volitional alternation. In this list, the reading \zhc{見}{ɣenH} is often considered to reflect a zero-derivation causative use of \zhc{現}{ɣenH} (\citealt[282-4]{wangyt14jingdian}).

Comparative data from other TH languages does not support the idea of a `volitional' nasal prefix, except possibly one example in Rgyalrong languages (§ \ref{sec:YAnmu}).

\subsection{Nominalization} {sec:oc.voice.nmlz}
Another function of the voicing alternation proposed by \citet[55]{bs14oc} is the derivation of an `agentive/instrumental noun' from a (transitive) verb, as shown by the examples in Table \ref{tab:nmlz.voicing.oc}.


\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Voicing alternation and nominalization} \label{tab:nmlz.voicing.oc}
\begin{tabular}{llllllllll}
\toprule
Unvoiced form &Meaning & Voiced form & Meaning\\
\midrule
\zhc{包}{pæw} \mc{幫}	&wrap, bundle & \zhc{袍}{baw} \mc{並} & long robe \\
\zhc{判}{phanH} \mc{滂}	&divide & \zhc{畔}{banH} \mc{並} & bank between fields \\
\zhc{拄}{ʈjuX} \mc{知}	&prop up, support  & \zhc{柱}{ɖjuX} \mc{澄} & pillar \\
\zhc{稱}{tɕʰiŋ} \mc{昌}	&weigh; evaluate; call & \zhc{稱}{tɕʰiŋH} \mc{昌} & steelyard \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The last example in Table \ref{tab:nmlz.voicing.oc} does not present voicing alternation in Middle Chinese, but \citet{bs14oc} propose that a nominalization prefix \ipa{*mə-} similar to the one hypothesized in the other three examples has to be reconstructed for the noun \zhc{稱}{tɕʰiŋH} `steelyard' (for which their OC reconstruction is \ipa{*mə-tʰəŋ-s}), on the basis of Hmong-Mien forms like Jiangdi Mien \ipa{dzjaŋ^5} `steelyard' (\citealt[68]{maozw92mien}, \zh{秤}), whose initial \ipa{dz-} unproblematically originates from a prenasalized aspirated affricate. However, the base verb \ipa{dzjaŋ^1} `weigh' (\citealt[167]{maozw92mien}, \zh{称}) is also attested in Mien with a voiced initial, indicating that the Chinese donor had prenasalization in both the verb and the noun. What this pair reflects is simply a case of \textit{qùshēng} nominalization (on which see \citealt{downer59}, \citealt{jacques16ssuffixes}), and cannot be used to prove that a nasal nominalization prefix did exist in Old Chinese.

There is some evidence, mainly from Jinghpo but also from Tibetan, that a nominalization nasal prefix did exist (§ \ref{sec:voice.nmlz}).

\subsection{Denominal verbs}
\citet[55]{bs14oc} also mention a few noun-verb pairs with voicing alternation (Table \ref{tab:denominal.oc}). In this table, nouns have an unvoiced unaspirated initial, and  verbs a voiced one. If we accept the idea that the origin of the voicing alternation in this case is similar to that of the transitivity alternation, ie the voiced forms derive from the unvoiced ones, this derivation is a denominal verbalization. Rgyalrong languages are particularly rich in denominal derivations (§ \ref{sec:denominal}), some of which are potentially comparable to the phenomenon observed here.

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Voicing alternation and verbalization} \label{tab:denominal.oc}
\begin{tabular}{llllllllll}
\toprule
Unvoiced form &Meaning & Voiced form & Meaning\\
\midrule
\zhc{背}{pwojH} \mc{幫}	&the back& \zhc{背}{bwojH} \mc{並} & turn the back on \\
\zhc{倉}{tsʰaŋ} \mc{清}	&granary & \zhc{藏}{dzaŋ} \mc{從} & store (v) \\
\zhc{朝}{ʈjew} \mc{知}	&morning  & \zhc{朝}{ɖjew} \mc{澄} & go to (morning) audience at court \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section{Passive and anticausative vs causative} \label{sec:anticausative.passive}

\subsection{Anticausative derivation in Rgyalrongic}
All Rgyalrongic languages have an anticausative derivation, affecting a limited number of verbs (\citealt{jacques15spontaneous}, \citealt[547]{lai17khroskyabs}). Table \ref{tab:anticausative} lists all examples of anticausative verbs in Japhug.

The base verbs are all morphologically transitive, and the derived ones intransitive, with their only argument corresponding to the object of the base verb. There are three independent pieces of evidence showing that the directionality of this derivation is from transitive to intransitive, and not the other way round. 

First, one can derive the intransitive forms from the transitive ones, but not the other way round, since aspirated and unaspirated obstruents correspond both to prenasalized ones. The same is observed in particular in Khroskyabs (\citealt[547-550]{lai17khroskyabs}).

Second, in Japhug the borrowed Tibetan verb \ipa{χtɤr} `spill' has an intransitive counterpart \ipa{ʁndɤr} `be spilled' which underwent this prenasalizing alternation (there are no verbs in any variety of Tibetan which could yield the form \ipa{ʁndɤr}, as the cluster \ipa{ʁnd-} does not conform to the phonotactics of Tibetan clusters). 

Third, the notion that in verb pairs of this type, the transitive verb derives from the intransitive one by means of an causative \ipa{s-} prefix is incompatible with the fact that in Rgyalrongic, the causative is still productive and can in some cases be added even to anticausative verbs, as \ipa{ftʂi} `melt' (vt) $\rightarrow$ \ipa{ndʐi} `melt' (vi, anticausative) $\rightarrow$ \ipa{sɯɣ-ndʐi} `melt' (vt, anticausative+causative).

It is significant that this list includes    \ipa{kɤɣ}  `to bend' vs \ipa{ŋgɤɣ} `to be bent'
