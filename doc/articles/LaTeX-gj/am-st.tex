\title{Associated motion in Sino-Tibetan/Trans-Himalayan}
\author{Guillaume Jacques\\ Aimée Lahaussois \\ Zhang Shuya}
\maketitle
%\textbf{Abstract}: While the term `associated motion' has up to now only been applied to a relatively limited number of Sino-Tibetan languages (Japhug and Karbi, see \citealt{jacques13harmonization} and \citealt{konnerth15cisloc}), the phenomenon itself is not rare in this family. This paper comprises three sections. 
%
%First, I provide an overview of associated motion morphology in Sino-Tibetan, focusing especially on Kiranti and Gyalrongic, the two subgroups of the family where this morphology is most complex,  on the basis of fieldwork data and published literature (in particular \citealt{driem87}, \citealt{driem93dumi}, \citealt{doornenbal09} and \citealt{schackow15yakkha}). 
%
%Second, I present a preliminary typological comparison of Associated Motion in Sino-Tibetan with South America (\citealt{guillaume16am}) and Australia (\citealt{koch84associated.motion}) where this grammatical category has been identified and studied for a longer time. 
%
%Third, I discuss the sources of associated motion affixes in Sino-Tibetan, in particular the question whether these affixes have origins other than motion verbs.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Rgyalrongic}
Associated motion prefixes are reported in Japhug (\citealt{jacques13harmonization}), Zbu (Gong Xun, p.c.), Tshobdun (\citealt{jackson14morpho}) and Situ (\citealt[497-500]{prins16kyomkyo}), but not found in other Gyalrongic languages (for example in Khroskyabs, cf \citealt{lai17khroskyabs}).

All four Gyalrong language have two associated motion prefixes (the Japhug forms are presented in Table \ref{tab:am-japhug}) grammaticalized from the motion verbs `go' and `come'. They refer to a motion event occurring before the action of the main verb

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Associated motion prefixes in Japhug} \centering \label{tab:am-japhug}
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
\toprule
AM & Verb &\\

\forme{ɣɯ-} & \japhug{ɣi}{come} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Pluri- vs monoactionality in Japhug}
To express the meaning of motion prior to an action, associated motion prefixes are nearly two times as common as corresponding motion verb constructions (henceforth MVC) in the Japhug corpus. There is however a clear semantic difference between the two constructions, which was briefly described in \citet{jacques13harmonization}, but is presented here in more detail.

AM and MVC differ from each other in that in the former, the completion of both motion event and verbal action is presupposed (AM is monoactional), whereas in the case of the latter, the two can be separated. This mono- vs. pluractionality contrast is most conspicuous in past perfective forms, and can be observed in four types of constructions: concessives (with negation of the verbal action), interrogatives, conditionals and complement clauses.

\subsubsection{Concessive} \label{sec:am.concessive}
A MVC  with the motion verb in perfective form can be followed by a clause negating the purposive action, as in (\ref{ex:nAkWrtoR}). In this example, only the motion is realized, while the action expressed by the verb \japhug{rtoʁ}{look} could not be accomplished.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:nAkWrtoR}
\gll nɤ-kɯ-rtoʁ jɤ-ɣe-a ri, mɯ-nɯ-atɯɣ-tɕi, mɯ-pɯ-ta-mto. \\
\textsc{1sg.poss}-\textsc{nmlz}:S/A-see \textsc{pfv}-come[II]-\textsc{1sg} \textsc{lnk} \textsc{neg}-\textsc{pfv}-meet-\textsc{1du} \textsc{neg}-\textsc{pfv}-1\fl2-see \\
\glt `I came to see you but I did not see you.' 
\end{exe}

With the corresponding AM verb form \japhug{ɣɯ-jɤ-ta-rtoʁ}{I came to see you}, negating the action of the verb is self-contradictory and nonsensical, and a sentence such as (\ref{ex:GWjAtartoR}) is incorrect.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:GWjAtartoR}
\gll $\dagger$ɣɯ-jɤ-ta-rtoʁ ri mɯ-pɯ-ta-mto \\
\textsc{cisloc}-\textsc{pfv}-1\fl2-look \textsc{lnk} \textsc{neg}-\textsc{pfv}-1\fl2-see \\
\glt Intended meaning: `I came to see you but I did not see you.' 
\end{exe}

Additional minimal pairs of the same type are presented in \citet[202-203]{jacques13harmonization}.


 

\subsubsection{Interrogative} \label{sec:am.interrogative}
In interrogative clauses, MVCs are required to express meanings such as `What/who have you come/gone to X', as in example (\ref{ex:tChi.WkWpa}), an example which occurs nine times in the corpus.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:tChi.WkWpa}
\gll tɕʰi ɯ-kɯ-pa jɤ-tɯ-ɣe? \\
what \textsc{3sg.poss}-do \textsc{pfv}-2-come[II] \\
\glt `What did you come to do?' (nine examples in the corpus)
\end{exe}

The difference between MVC and AM in interrogatives can be illustrated by comparing the minimal pair  (\ref{ex:tChi.WkWndza}) and (\ref{ex:tChi.GWtAtWndzat}). example (\ref{ex:tChi.WkWndza}), which has the same structure as (\ref{ex:tChi.WkWpa}), implies that the addressee has not eaten yet, while (\ref{ex:tChi.GWtAtWndzat}) with associated motion can only be used if the food ingestion has already taken place, and requires a different translation.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:tChi.WkWndza}
\gll tɕʰi ɯ-kɯ-ndza jɤ-tɯ-ɣe? \\
what \textsc{3sg.poss}-eat \textsc{pfv}-2-come[II] \\
\glt `What have you come to eat?' (elicited)
\end{exe}

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:tChi.GWtAtWndzat}
\gll tɕʰi ɣɯ-tɤ-tɯ-ndza-t \\
what \textsc{cisloc}-\textsc{pfv}-2-eat-\textsc{pst:tr}    \\
\glt `What did you eat, after you came here?' (elicited)
\end{exe}

\subsubsection{Conditional} \label{sec:am.conditional}
The presuppositional difference between MVC and AM is also perceptible in the protasis of conditional clauses. 

With MVC in the protasis as in (\ref{ex:mWmAjAtWGe}), there is no presupposition that the verbal action took place, only the motion event constitutes a condition to the state of affair described in the apodosis.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:mWmAjAtWGe}
\gll nɤ-wa ɯ-kɯ-rtoʁ mɯ\redp{}mɤ-jɤ-tɯ-ɣe nɤ aʑo mɯ-pɯ-kɯ-mto-a. \\
\textsc{1sg.poss}-father \textsc{3sg.poss-}\textsc{nmlz}:S/A-look \textsc{cond}\redp{}\textsc{neg}-\textsc{pfv}-2-come[II] \textsc{lnk} \textsc{1sg} \textsc{neg}-\textsc{pfv}-2\fl{}1-\textsc{1sg} \\
\glt `If you had not come to see your father, you would not have seen me.' (you saw me, but your father was not here)
\end{exe}

By contrast, with AM, the verbal action necessarily took place, as in example (\ref{ex:mWmAGWjAtWrtoR}).

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:mWmAGWjAtWrtoR}
\gll nɤ-wa  mɯ\redp{}mɤ-ɣɯ-jɤ-tɯ-rtoʁ nɤ pɯ-sɤzdɯxpa \\
\textsc{1sg.poss}-father \textsc{cond}\redp{}\textsc{neg}-\textsc{cisloc}-\textsc{pfv}-2-look \textsc{lnk} \textsc{pst.ipfv}-be.pitiful \\ 
\glt `If you had not come to see your father, he would have felt sorry.' (but you did saw him, so he does not feel sorry)
\end{exe}

\subsubsection{Complement clauses} \label{sec:am.conditional}
In complement clauses, verbs with AM prefixes are attested, and complement taking verbs always have scope over both the action of the verb and motion event.

 
In (\ref{ex:mACWkAtshi}), the modal verb \japhug{cʰa}{can} and the double negations (with the specific meaning `cannot help') have scope over both the motion event and the verbal action -- this example is taken from a passage in a story where the king reproaches a small child, who just returned from a mission he himself send him to accomplish, not to have first come to greet him on his return home; the child says these words to justify why he first went to see his mother before greeting the king -- from this context it is clear that both the motion event (to him mother's house, explaining the child's failure to go to see the king) and the action `drink milk' (the reason for that motion event) are equally important to the plot and inseparable. 

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:mACWkAtshi}
\gll  tɯ-nɯ ɯ-kɯ-tsʰi ɲɯ-ɕti-a tɕe, jɤ-azɣɯt-a tɕe, tɯ-nɯ ci mɤ-ɕɯ-kɤ-tsʰi nɯ mɯ́j-cʰa-a \\
\textsc{indef}.\textsc{poss}-breast \textsc{3sg}.\textsc{poss}-\textsc{nmlz}:S/A-drink \textsc{sens}-be.\textsc{affirm}-\textsc{1sg} \textsc{lnk} \textsc{pfv}-arrive-\textsc{1sg} \textsc{lnk} \textsc{indef}.\textsc{poss}-breast  \textsc{indef} \textsc{neg}-\textsc{transloc}-\textsc{inf}-drink \textsc{dem} \textsc{neg}:\textsc{sens}-can-\textsc{1sg} \\
\glt `I am (a toddler) who (still) drinks (his mother's) milk, when I arrived, I could not help but go to drink milk.'  (Norbzang, 262)
 \end{exe}
 
 In (\ref{ex:CWkAmWrkW.mAtWcha}), the negated modal verb has also on the action of both the main verb and the motion event -- the guards would prevent the main character not only to steal, but also to the where the object to be stolen is found.
 
\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:CWkAmWrkW.mAtWcha}
\gll ʁmaʁ χsɯ-tɤkʰar kɯ ɲɯ-ɤz-nɤkʰar-nɯ ɕti tɕe, ɕɯ-kɤ-mɯrkɯ mɤ-tɯ-cʰa  \\
solider three-rounds \textsc{erg} \textsc{sens}-\textsc{prog}-surround-\textsc{pl} be.\textsc{affirm}:\textsc{fact} \textsc{lnk}  \textsc{transloc}-\textsc{inf}-steal \textsc{neg}-2-can:\textsc{fact} \\
\glt `Three rounds of soldiers will be surrounding it, you will not be able to (go there and) steal it.' (2003qachga, 55)
   \end{exe}
 
The same observation also applies to  verbs with AM in complement clauses selected by a verb in the protasis, as in(\ref{ex:CWkAmWrkW}): the realization of the verbal action (in addition to that of the motion event) belongs to the condition.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:CWkAmWrkW}
\gll nɤʑo ɕɯ-kɤ-mɯrkɯ a-pɯ-tɯ-cʰa nɤ aʑo cʰɯ-sɯ-jɣat-a jɤɣ \\
\textsc{2sg} \textsc{transloc}-\textsc{inf}-steal \textsc{irr}-\textsc{ipfv}-2-can \textsc{lnk} \textsc{1sg} \textsc{ipfv}-\textsc{caus}-go.back-\textsc{1sg} be.agreed:\textsc{fact} \\
\glt `If you succeed stealing it (after having gone there), I can cause him to go back there.' (02-montagnes-kamnyu, 46)
\end{exe}

By contrast, in  (\ref{ex:kWrAma.kACe}), in the case of the infinitival complement \forme{kɯ-rɤma kɤ-ɕe} `go to work' with a purposive clause \forme{kɯ-rɤma} (§ XXX), the main verb \japhug{mda}{be time to} only has scope over the motion event expressed by the verb \japhug{ɕe}{go} -- the time that is indicated by the stars refers to the beginning of the journey to work, not the start of the work itself.
 
 \begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:kWrAma.kACe}
\gll  tɕe kɯɕɯŋgɯ tɕe tɯtsʰot pɯ-me tɕe  nɯnɯ cʰɯ-ɬoʁ lu-ɕqʰlɤt nɯra ɕ-tu-kɯ-ru tɕe, nɯnɯ kɤ-rɤru mda mɤ-mda cʰondɤre kɯ-rɤma kɤ-ɕe mda mɤ-mda nɯtɕu ɕ-tu-kɯ-ru pɯ-ŋgrɤl. \\
 \textsc{lnk} long.ago \textsc{lnk} clock \textsc{pst}.\textsc{ipfv}-not.exist \textsc{lnk} \textsc{dem} \textsc{ipfv}:\textsc{downstream}-come.out \textsc{ipfv}:\textsc{upstream}-disappear \textsc{dem}:\textsc{pl} \textsc{transloc}-\textsc{ipfv}:up-\textsc{genr}:S/P-look \textsc{lnk} \textsc{dem} \textsc{inf}-get.up be.time:\textsc{fact} \textsc{neg}-be.time:\textsc{fact} \textsc{comit} \textsc{nmlz}:S/A-work \textsc{inf}-go be.time:\textsc{fact} \textsc{neg}-be.time:\textsc{fact} \textsc{dem}:\textsc{loc} \textsc{transloc}-\textsc{ipfv}:up-\textsc{genr}:S/P-look \textsc{pst}.\textsc{ipfv}-be.usually.the.case  \\
 \glt  `In former times, there was no clock, and people used to watch when (these stars) came out or disappeared (to know) whether it was time to get up or go to work.' (29-LAntshAm, 66)
  \end{exe}
