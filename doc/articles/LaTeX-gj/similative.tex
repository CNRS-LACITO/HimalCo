\section*{Introduction}

\section{Related constructions}
Before presenting similative construction, I provide a brief account of three types of related construction: degree, comparative and superlative, some of which present commonalities with the constructions described in section \ref{sec:arg.similative}.

\subsection{Degree construction}
The degree of an adjectival predicate can be expressed in two ways, either with a degree adverb, or using the nominalized degree construction.

\subsubsection{Degree adverb} \label{sec:wuma}
The degree adverb construction is very familiar; it involves the adverb \forme{wuma}{really, very}, which can appear either close to the verb (as in \ref{ex:tCur}) or separated from the verb by a noun phrase as in (\ref{ex:pWdAn}).

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:tCur}
\gll \ipa{tɕe} 	\ipa{nɯnɯ} 	\ipa{wuma} 	\ipa{ʑo} 	\ipa{tɕur} 	\ipa{ri} \\
\textsc{lnk} \textsc{dem} really  \textsc{emph} be.sour:\textsc{fact} but \\
\glt `It is very sour.' (09 mi, 67)
\end{exe}

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:pWdAn}
\gll
\ipa{nɤʑo} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{wuma} 	\ipa{ʑo} 	\ipa{nɤ-ma} 	\ipa{pɯ-dɤn} 	\ipa{ɯ́-ŋu?}  \\
\textsc{2sg} \textsc{dem} really \textsc{emph} \textsc{2sg.poss}-work \textsc{pst.ipfv}-be.many \textsc{qu}-be \\
\glt `You had a lot of work, didn't you?' (conversation, 2015)
\end{exe}

Although \forme{wuma}{really, very} is borrowed from Tibetan \ipa{ŋo.ma}, this word is not used in this way in Tibetan languages as far as I know, and despite the deep typological and lexical influence of Tibetan on Japhug, the expression of degree in Tibetan uses unrelated constructions (\citealt{simon15evaluative}).

\subsubsection{Nominalized degree construction} \label{sec:NDC}
A more elaborated construction to express degree in Japhug involves nominalizing the adjectives by means of the action nominal prefix \ipa{tɯ-} and adding a possessive prefix before it coreferent with the subject, as in the form \forme{ɯ-tɯ-tɕur}{its sourness} in example (\ref{ex:WtWCur}), followed by a predicate expressing the degree such as  \forme{saχaʁ}{be extremely} in this example. Other possible predicates include \forme{tɕʰom}{be too much} or \forme{naχtɕɯɣ}{be identical}; in the latter case it becomes a similative construction (see section \ref{sec:NDC.similative}).  As shown in (\ref{ex:YWsWxtCur}), the degree nominal can be followed by the ergative \ipa{kɯ} and a full clause describing the degree of the property described by the adjective (`so X that Y').

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:WtWCur}
\gll 
\ipa{mtɕʰi}  	\ipa{ɯ-mat}  	\ipa{rca}  	\ipa{ɯ-tɯ-tɕur}  	\ipa{saχaʁ.}  	   \\
sea.buckthorn \textsc{3sg.poss}-fruit \textsc{unexpected} \textsc{3sg-nmlz:degree}-be.sour be.extremely:\textsc{fact}   \\
\glt `The fruit of the sea-buckthorn is very sour,' (09 mi, 65)
\end{exe}

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:YWsWxtCur}
\gll 
 	[\ipa{ɯ-tɯ-tɕur}]  	\ipa{\textbf{kɯ}}  	[\ipa{tɯ-kɯr}  	\ipa{ɯ-ŋgɯ}  	\ipa{lú-wɣ-rku}  	\ipa{qʰe}  	\ipa{maka}  	\ipa{ɲɯ-sɯ-ɤmɯzɣɯt}  	\ipa{qʰe,}  	\ipa{tɯ-pʰoŋbu}  	\ipa{ra}  	\ipa{kɯnɤ}  	\ipa{ɲɯ-sɯx-tɕur}  	\ipa{kɯ-fse}  	\ipa{ɕti}]  \\
  \textsc{3sg-nmlz:degree}-be.sour \textsc{erg} \textsc{indef:poss}-mouth \textsc{3sg}-inside \textsc{ipfv:upstream-inv}-put.in \textsc{lnk} at.all \textsc{ipfv-caus}-be.evenly.distributed \textsc{lnk} \textsc{indef:poss}-body \textsc{pl} also \textsc{ipfv-caus}-be.sour \textsc{nmlz:S/A}-be.like be:\textsc{affirm}:\textsc{fact} \\
\glt `(The fruit of the sea-buckthorn) is so sour that when one puts it in one's mouth, it makes it completely (sour), and it is as if one's (whole) body became sour.' (09 mi, 66)
\end{exe}

This construction is common in Japhug (\citealt[8]{jacques16comparative}) and attested in other Rgyalrong languages such as Tshobdun (\citealt[911]{jackson06guanxiju}).

\subsection{Comparative}
The comparative construction in Japhug can be illustrated by example (\ref{ex:comp1}): the  standard is marked by the postposition \ipa{sɤz} `than' specifically used in this construction, and the comparee is marked by the ergative  \ipa{kɯ}. In comparative constructions, it is common for ergative or instrumental markers to be used with the standard, but this use on the comparee is unexpected (\citealt{jacques16comparative}).

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:comp1}
\gll  \ipa{ɯ-ʁi}   	\ipa{sɤz}   	[\ipa{ɯ-pi}   	\ipa{nɯ}]   	\ipa{\textbf{kɯ}}   	\ipa{mpɕɤr}     \\
\textsc{3sg.poss}-younger.sibling \textsc{comparative} \textsc{3sg.poss}-elder.sibling \textsc{dem} \textsc{erg}  be.beautiful:\textsc{fact} \\
\glt `The elder one is more beautiful than the young one.' (elicited)
\end{exe}

\subsection{Superlative}
There are no less than three constructions expressing superlative meaning in Japhug: a degree adverb meaning `most', a possessed subject participle (`Y is the X one of ...') and a relative clause with a negative existential verb (`There is no X one like Y').

 \subsubsection{Degree adverb}
 The degree adverb superlative is a familiar construction, illustrated by example (\ref{ex:stu1}) with an adjective in finite small (factual non-past).
 
\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:stu1}
\gll 
\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{pɣɤtɕɯ} 	\ipa{nɯ-ŋgɯz} 	\ipa{stu} 	\ipa{xtɕi} 	\ipa{lo} \\
\textsc{dem} bird \textsc{3pl.poss-}among most be.small:\textsc{fact} \textsc{sfp} \\
\glt `It is the smallest of all birds.' (hist-24-ZmbrWpGa, 126)
\end{exe}

Most examples of this construction appear however with adjectives in subject participle form,\footnote{For an account of participial forms and a definition of subject and objects  in Rgyalrong languages, see \citet{jackson03caodeng, jackson14morpho, jacques16relatives}.} prefixed with \ipa{kɯ-} as in (\ref{ex:stu2}).

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:stu2}
\gll \ipa{kɯɕɯŋgɯ} 	\ipa{tɕe} 	<aizheng> 	\ipa{kɤ-ti} 	\ipa{pɯ-me} 	\ipa{tɕe,} 	\ipa{kɤ-kɯ-nɤndza} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{stu} 	\ipa{ʑo} 	\ipa{kɯ-ŋɤn} 	\ipa{kɤ-pa} 	\ipa{pɯ-ŋu} \\
long.ago \textsc{lnk} cancer \textsc{nmlz}:P-say \textsc{pst.ipfv}-not.exist \textsc{lnk} \textsc{pfv}-\textsc{nmlz}:S/A-have.leprosy \textsc{dem} most \textsc{emph} \textsc{nmlz}:S/A-be.evil \textsc{nmlz}:P-do \textsc{pst.ipfv}-be \\
\glt `In former times, nobody talked about cancer, and leprosy was considered to be the most terrible (of all diseases).' (hist-25-khArWm, 35)
\end{exe}

It is also possible to find this construction with oblique participles, as in (\ref{ex:stu3}), the only such example in the corpus.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:stu3}
\gll 
\ipa{stu} 	\ipa{ɯ-sɤ-dɤn} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{stɤmku} 	\ipa{nɯra} 	\ipa{ŋu-nɯ} \\
most \textsc{3sg.poss-nmlz:oblique}-be.many \textsc{dem} prairie \textsc{dem:pl} be:\textsc{fact-pl} \\
\glt `The places where most of them are are the prairies.' (hist-19-qachGa mWntoR, 24)
\end{exe}

 \subsubsection{Possessed participle}
Another possibility to express superlative is with an adjective in participial form  with a third plural possessive marker, as in (\ref{ex:super2}).
 
 \begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:super2}
\gll 
\ipa{tɕe} 	\ipa{pɣa} 	\ipa{tʰamtɕɤt} 	\ipa{ɣɯ} 	\ipa{nɯ-kɯ-mpɕɤr} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{rmɤβja} 	\ipa{ɲɯ-ŋu} \\
\textsc{lnk} bird all \textsc{gen} \textsc{3pl.poss-nmlz}:S/A-be.beautiful \textsc{dem} peacock \textsc{sens}-be \\
\glt  `The peacock is the most beautiful of all birds.' (24-ZmbrWpGa, 84)
\end{exe}

This construction is less flexible, and mainly occurs with the adjectives \forme{mpɕɤr}{be beautiful} and \forme{mna}{be well}.

 \subsubsection{Relative} \label{sec:relative.superlative}
 A more idiomatic way of expressing superlative meaning in Japhug is by means of negative existential verb combined with a relative and a adjunct with the participial form of \forme{fse}{be in this way, be like}, as in (\ref{ex:kWfse.me}). This construction is a particular use of the similative construction described in section \ref{sec:fse}.
 
 \begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:kWfse.me}
\gll \ipa{ama} 	\ipa{a-pi} 	\ipa{kʰu} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{tɕʰindʐa} 	\ipa{ku-tɯ-nɤpʰɯpʰɣo} 	\ipa{tɕe}  \ipa{nɤʑo} 	\ipa{kɯ-fse} 	\ipa{kɯ-sɤɣmu} 	\ipa{me} 	\\
\textsc{surprise} \textsc{1sg.poss}-elder.sibling tiger \textsc{dem} why \textsc{prs.ego}-2-flee.here.and.there \textsc{lnk} \textsc{2sg}  \textsc{nmlz}:S/A-be.like   \textsc{nmlz}:S/A-be.dreadful  not.exist:\textsc{fact} \\
\glt `Brother tiger, why are you running away like that, you are the most dreadful (animal).' (literally `There is no one dreadful like you') (2005khu, 25)
\end{exe}

This construction is potentially ambiguous, and when the relative has a finite main verb (when the relativized element is the object, see \citealt{jacques16relatives}), it is possible in some cases, to use orientation prefixes to disambiguate. In example (\ref{ex:tusWza}), the verb \forme{sɯz}{know} in the superlative construction takes the `up' prefix instead of the expected `down' prefix that it normally selects to build most tenses. With the  `down' prefix, scope of the negation is different, a smenatic difference that may have to do with syntactic boundaries; in (\ref{ex:tusWza}), the relative is limited to a single word \ipa{tu-sɯz-a} `(that) I know' and the negation applies exclusively to it, whereas in (\ref{ex:pjWsWza}) the negation applies to the whole constituent indicated between square brackets.
 

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:tusWza}
\gll \ipa{aʑo} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{kɯ-fse} 	\ipa{ʑo} 	\ipa{maka} [\ipa{tu-tso-a}] 	\ipa{me,} [\ipa{tu-sɯz-a}] 	\ipa{me} \\
\textsc{1sg} \textsc{dem} \textsc{nmlz}:S/A-be.like \textsc{emph} at.all \textsc{ipfv:up}-understand-\textsc{1sg} not.exist:\textsc{fact} \textsc{ipfv:up}-know-\textsc{1sg} not.exist:\textsc{fact} \\
\glt `There is nothing I know better than that.' (140519 yeying, 62)
\end{exe}

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:pjWsWza}
\gll [\ipa{aʑo} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{kɯ-fse} 	\ipa{pjɯ-sɯz-a}]	\ipa{me} \\
\textsc{1sg} \textsc{dem} \textsc{nmlz}:S/A-be.like \textsc{ipfv}-know-\textsc{1sg} not.exist:\textsc{fact} \\
\glt `I know of no such thing.'
\end{exe}

This contrast cannot however be generalized to all verbs and it is unclear for now to what extent this is a widespread phenomenon in Japhug grammar.

\section{Argument similative} \label{sec:arg.similative}
This section discusses the argument similative construction, that constructions expressing that two entities have a property in equal degree (X is as Y as Z). It differs from predicate similative, treated in section \ref{sec:pred.similative}, expressing that the same entity has two properties in equal degree (X is a Y as he is Z). In the following, I adopt the generally accepted terminology used in the description of comparative construction (\citealt{dixon08comparative}), as illustrated by the English example (\ref{ex:similative.eng}). Similative construction can be considered to be a special case of comparatives. The main difference with other comparative construction is that since the comparee and the standard are identical as regards to the parameter, they can be considered to be interchangeable, and will be referred to instead as \textsc{comparee} 1 and 2 in the following discussion.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:similative.eng}
\gll  John is as intelligent as Paul \\
\textsc{comparee 1} { } \textsc{index} \textsc{parameter} \textsc{mark} \textsc{standard/comparee 2}  \\
\end{exe}

There are no less than four distinct constructions expressing argument similative meaning in Japhug. 

\subsection{\forme{fse}{be like}} \label{sec:fse}
One similative construction is built with the verb \forme{fse}{be like} (or more rarely the verb \forme{afsuja}{be of the same size}) as the \textsc{mark} on the comparee 2.

It is most commonly in participial form (\ipa{kɯ-fse}) as in  example (\ref{ex:kWfse.kWchWcha}). The main verb (the \textsc{parameter}) is also nearly always in participial form, and the construction is mainly used in relative clauses with one of the comparees as the relativized element. The superlative construction studied in section \ref{sec:relative.superlative} is essentially a particular use of such relativized similative sentences.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:kWfse.kWchWcha}
\gll \ipa{aʑo} 	\ipa{kɯ-fse} 	\ipa{kɯ-cʰɯ\rdp{}cʰa} 	\ipa{ʑo} 	\ipa{ʁʑɯnɯ} 	\ipa{ɣurʑa} 	\ipa{kɯrcat} 	\ipa{ra}  \\
\textsc{1sg} \textsc{nmlz}:S/A-be.like \textsc{nmlz}:S/A-\textsc{emph}\rdp{}can \textsc{emph} young.man hundred eight have.to:\textsc{fact} \\
\glt `I need a hundred and eight young men as able as I am.' (x1-sloXpWn, 17)
\end{exe}

Alternatively, it is also possible to use a finite form for both the \textsc{mark} \forme{fse}{be like} and the \textsc{parameter} as in (\ref{ex:fsWfse}), though such examples are rare in the corpus.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:fsWfse}
\gll
\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{li} 	\ipa{ɯ-wa} 	\ipa{fsɯfse} 	\ipa{ʑo} 	\ipa{pjɤ-fse} 	\ipa{pjɤ-sɤjloʁ} \\
\textsc{dem} again \textsc{3sg.poss}-father completely.like \textsc{emph} \textsc{ifr.ipfv}-be.like \textsc{ifr.ipfv}-be.ugly \\
\glt `(The frog son) was as ugly as his father. ' (hist150818 muzhi guniang, 100)
\end{exe}

These constructions do not require an \textsc{index}, though adverbs \forme{fsɯfse}{completely identical} can serve as redundant indexes, as in (\ref{ex:fsWfse}).

A similar similative construction in attested in the Kyomkyo dialect of Situ Rgyalrong (\citealt[238]{prins11kyomkyo}), though with the \textsc{mark} expressed by the participial form of the Tibetan loanword \forme{ndʐa}{be like} instead of the native root corresponding to Japhug \forme{fse}{be like}.

This similative construction corresponds to \citealt{haspelmath17equative}'s type 1 (Only equative standard-marker)

\subsection{Nominalized degree construction} \label{sec:NDC.similative}
This construction is a particular case of the Nominalized Degree Construction presented in section \ref{sec:NDC}. It is by far the most common way of expressing similative meaning in Japhug. It has three slightly different variants. 

In the first construction, the two \textsc{comparees} are included in a noun phrase, with the comitative marker \ipa{cʰo} (and its longer variant \ipa{cʰondɤre}) serving as the \textsc{mark} after one of them. This noun phrase is followed by an adjective (the \textsc{parameter}) in degree nominal form (prefixed with \ipa{tɯ-} and a possessive prefix (in dual or plural) coreferent with the preceding noun phrase. This nominalized verb and the preceding noun phrase form a noun phrase that is the subject of the adjective \forme{naχtɕɯɣ}{be identical} (the \textsc{index})\footnote{The adjective \forme{naχtɕɯɣ}{be identical} is a denominal verb derived from the a non-attested form *\ipa{χtɕɯɣ} borrowed from the Tibetan numeral \forme{gtɕig}{one}. } in finite form, as in examples (\ref{ex:ndZitWwxti}) and (\ref{ex:ndZitWmbro}).

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:ndZitWwxti}
\glll
\ipa{qalekɯtsʰi} 	\ipa{nɯnɯ} 	\ipa{cʰondɤre} 	\ipa{βʑar} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{ndʑi-tɯ-wxti} 	\ipa{naχtɕɯɣ} \\
bird.sp \textsc{dem} \textsc{comit} bird.sp \textsc{dem} \textsc{3du.poss-nmlz:degree}-be.big be.identical:\textsc{fact} \\
{\textsc{comparee} 1} { } \textsc{mark} {\textsc{comparee} 2} { } \textsc{parameter} \textsc{index} \\
\glt The \ipa{qalekɯtsʰi} bird is as big as the \ipa{βʑar} bird. (hist-23-RmWrcWftsa, 34)
\end{exe}

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:ndZitWmbro}
\gll 
\ipa{mɤ-mbro} 	\ipa{tɤru} 	\ipa{cʰo} 	\ipa{ndʑi-tɯ-mbro} 	\ipa{naχtɕɯɣ} \\
\textsc{neg}-be.high:\textsc{fact} tree.sp \textsc{comit} \textsc{3du.poss-nmlz:degree}-be.high be.identical:\textsc{fact} \\
\glt `It is not high, it (grows) as high as the \ipa{tɤru} tree.' (hist-17-xCAj, 56)
\end{exe}

In the second construction, the nominalized \textsc{parameter} takes a possessive prefix only coreferent with the \textsc{comparee} 1, and the \textsc{comparee} 2 together with the comitative (the \textsc{mark}) follows the parameter, as in (\ref{ex:WtWwxti}).

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:WtWwxti}
\glll
\ipa{qaliaʁ} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{ɯ-tɯ-wxti} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{qandʑɣi} 	\ipa{cʰo} 	\ipa{naχtɕɯɣ} 	\ipa{tsa} 	\\
eagle \textsc{dem} \textsc{3sg.poss-nmlz:degree}-be.big \textsc{dem} hawk \textsc{comit} be.identical:\textsc{fact} a.little  \\
{\textsc{comparee} 1} { } \textsc{parameter} { } {\textsc{comparee} 2} \textsc{mark} \textsc{index}  \textsc{index} \\
\glt `The eagle is about as big as the hawk.' (19-qandZGi, 36)
\end{exe}

In the third construction, the parameter takes a third person singular possessive prefix, and the two comparees are indicated by person indexation on the verb. In (\ref{ex:WtWmWCtaR}), the comparees are the speaker and the addressee; they are not expressed by overt pronouns, but are rather indexed on the verb by the suffix \ipa{tɕi}.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:WtWmWCtaR}
\glll
\ipa{tɕe} 	\ipa{ɯ-tɯ-mɯɕtaʁ} 	\ipa{ɲɯ-naχtɕɯɣ-tɕi} 	\ipa{tɕe,} 	\ipa{qʰe} 	\ipa{nɯ-tɤjpa} 	\ipa{ɲɯ-rkɯn} 	\ipa{ma} \\
\textsc{lnk} \textsc{3sg.poss-nmlz:degree}-be.cold \textsc{sens}-be.identical-\textsc{1du} \textsc{lnk} \textsc{2pl.poss}-snow \textsc{sens}-be.few \textsc{sfr} \\
{ } \textsc{parameter} \textsc{index-comparee} \\
\glt `It is as cold here as it is in your place, you don't have a lot of snow.' (`You and I are identical as to coldness'; conversation, 2014/11)
\end{exe}

These constructions correspond to \citet{haspelmath17equative}'s type 5 (Primary reach equative unified).

\subsection{Possessed noun} \label{sec:Wfsu}
The possessed noun \forme{ɯ-fsu}{of the same size as} can be used as the \textsc{mark} in a construction of \citet{haspelmath17equative}'s type 1 like the one discussed in section \ref{sec:fse}.\footnote{Incidentally, note that \forme{fse}{be like}, the verb which serves as the \textsc{mark} in the construction described in section \ref{sec:fse}, is etymologically related to \forme{ɯ-fsu}{of the same size as}.}

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:Wfsu}
\gll \ipa{tu-mbro} 	\ipa{tɕe,} 	\ipa{tɯrme} 	\ipa{ɯ-fsu} 	\ipa{jamar} 	\ipa{tu-βze} 	\ipa{cʰa} \\
\textsc{ipfv}-be.high \textsc{lnk} man \textsc{3sg.poss}-of.the.same.size.as about \textsc{ipfv}-grow can \\
\glt `It grows high, about as high as man.' (12-ndZiNgri, 4)
\end{exe}

This construction is relatively marginal in Japhug. In the Cogtse dialect of Situ Rgyalrong, a similar construction is reported (\citealt[377]{linxr93jiarong}).

\subsection{Denominal verbs}
Japhug has a denominal prefix \ipa{arɯ-} deriving adjectives meaning `like X' out of nouns. I have no examples from narratives, but it spontaneously occurs in conversation, as for instance (\ref{ex:arWsWjno}), which I heard as I was correcting the transcription of a story with my main informant. The more elaborated sentence (\ref{ex:YArWsWjno}) was given as an explanation for (\ref{ex:arWsWjno}).

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:arWsWjno}
\gll \ipa{ɯ-tɯ-ɤrɯsɯjno} 	\ipa{nɯ!}  \\
\textsc{3sg.poss-nmlz:degree}-be.like.grass \textsc{sfp} \\
\glt `(She cuts their head as easily) as if it were grass.' (heard in context)
\end{exe}

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:arWmWntoR}
\gll \ipa{ɯ-tɯ-ɤrɯmɯntoʁ} 	\ipa{nɯ!}  \\
\textsc{3sg.poss-nmlz:degree}-be.like.a.flower \textsc{sfp} \\
\glt `It is as (worthless) as a flower!'
\end{exe}


\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:YArWsWjno}
\gll  
\ipa{kɤ-pʰɯt} 	\ipa{ɯ-tɯ-mbat} 	\ipa{kɯ} 	\ipa{ɲɯ-ɤrɯsɯjno} 	\ipa{ʑo} \\
\textsc{inf}-cut  \textsc{3sg.poss-nmlz:degree}-easy \textsc{erg} \textsc{sens}-be.like.grass \\
\glt `It is as easy to cut as if it were grass.' 
\end{exe}

This unusual similative construction is productive, since it can be applied to nouns from Tibetan (\ref{ex:arWmWntoR}) or Chinese. I does not fit in any of \citet{haspelmath17equative}'s six types of similative construction.

%\ipa{afsujɯja} `be of same size'

\section{Predicate similative} \label{sec:pred.similative}
Predicate similative constructions (`X is as Y as he is Z') do not occur in the Japhug corpus. This meaning can however be expressed in Japhug. In order to limit the effect of elicitation, the following procedure was undertaken. I first wrote in Japhug a translation of Perrault's story `Riquet à la Houppe' which contains many examples of Predicate similative sentences. The translation was then corrected with my main informant sentence by sentence. Then, she was asked to retell the story (in six episodes of 3 to 5 minutes) using her own words.

Predicate similatives, for instance `X is as stupid as s/he is beautiful' (a sentence occurring several times in the story) can be expressed in Japhug in three distinct ways.

First, the possessed noun \forme{ɯ-fsu}{of the same size as} (used in the argument similative construction, section \ref{sec:Wfsu}), follows a degree noun with the first adjective; the second adjective takes a finite form.

\begin{exe}

Second, two adjectives in degree nominal form, the first followed by the comitative postposition \ipa{cʰo}, are subject of the verb \forme{afsuja}{be of the same size}. This construction is the equivalent of the argument similative construction in section \ref{sec:NDC.similative}.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:YAfsuja}
\gll 
\ipa{ɯ-tɯ-mpɕɤr} 	\ipa{cʰo} 	\ipa{ɯ-tɯ-kʰe} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{ɲɯ-ɤfsuja} 	\ipa{ɕti} \\
\textsc{3sg.poss-nmlz:degree}-be.beautiful \textsc{comit} \textsc{3sg.poss-nmlz:degree}-be.stupid \textsc{dem} sens-be.of.the.same.size be.\textsc{affirm:fact} \\
\glt `His/Her beauty and his/her stupidity are equal.'
\end{exe}

Third, it is possible to express the same meaning with a correlative construction, as in \ref{ex:correlative}. This construction however may be a calque from Chinese, and is of lesser interest to the study of Japhug grammar.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:correlative}
\gll 
\ipa{tɕʰi} 	\ipa{jamar} 	\ipa{kɯ-mpɕɤr} 	\ipa{nɯ,} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{jamar} 	\ipa{ci} 	\ipa{ɲɯ-kʰe} 	\ipa{ɕti} \\
what about \textsc{nmlz}:S/A-be.beautiful \textsc{dem} \textsc{dem} about \textsc{indef} \textsc{sens}-be.stupid be.\textsc{affirm:fact} \\
\glt `How beautiful s/he is, so stupid s/he is.'
\end{exe}

\section*{Conclusion}
The present paper documents various constructions in Japhug, some of which had never described previously. Japhug presents a rich array of similative constructions, some of the garden variety type, but other, like the denominal similative, appear quite unusual, and isolated at least areally.

Despite the lexical influence of Tibetan languages on Japhug, and the fact that some of the constructions described in this paper involve Tibetan borrowings (see sections \ref{sec:wuma} and \ref{sec:NDC.similative}), none of these constructions appear to be calqued from their Tibetan equivalents.
