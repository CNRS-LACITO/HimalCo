\title{A sketch of Japhug}
\author{Guillaume Jacques}
\maketitle

%\textbf{Abstract}: This chapter is a grammatical sketch of the Kamnyu variety of the Japhug language spoken in Mbarkham county, Rngaba prefecture, Sichuan Province, China. It focuses on verbal and nominal morphology, especially argument indexation, voice and tense-aspect-modality marking. The chapter also briefly describes relative clauses, complement clauses and comparative constructions.

\section{Introduction}
Japhug (\ipa{kɯrɯskɤt}) is one of the four Rgyalrong languages. It is spoken in Gdong-brgyad (\ipa{ʁdɯrɟɤt}), Gsar-rdzong (\ipa{sarndzu}) and Da-tshang (\ipa{tatsʰi}) areas in Mbarkhams (\ipa{mbarkʰom}) county, Sichuan province, China, by around 10000 speakers, and presents some dialectal diversity, especially in the Gdong-brgyad area.

Documentation on this language includes various articles, a short grammar with glossary (\citealt{jacques08}) and a text collection (\citealt{jacques10gesar}).

Like all Rgyalrongic languages, Japhug has undergone considerable lexical influence from Tibetan (\citealt{jacques04these}), but this influence is less conspicuous in the domain of morphosyntax.



\section{Phonology}
Japhug has complex onsets with 49 consonant phonemes and at least 403 consonant clusters (307 biconsonantal and 96 triconsonantal clusters), of which 58 are only attested in ideophones (\citealt{japhug14ideophones}) and 30 in Tibetan loanwords. Among the most unusual clusters in Japhug, we find palatal stop+\ipa{ɣ} (\ipa{lɟɣaʁ} `hang on sth'), clusters with \ipa{j--} as first element (\ipa{jpum} `thick') and fricative + prenasalized stop (\ipa{ʑmbrɯ} `boat')


Only twelve   consonants appear in coda position, and no clusters are allowed:  \ipa{--p}, \ipa{--β}, \ipa{--m}, \ipa{--t}, \ipa{--z}, \ipa{--n}, \ipa{--l}, \ipa{--r}, \ipa{--j}, \ipa{--ɣ}, \ipa{--ŋ}, \ipa{--ʁ}. The stop \ipa{--p} is only attested in a few ideophones, and the only final stop in non-ideophonic vocabulary is \ipa{--t}. Final voiced segments, whether sonorant or obstruents, are devoiced before a pause but voicing surfaces in sandhi.

Japhug differs from all other Rgyalrong languages in that it has lost tonal contrasts. The only suprasegmental feature is the word stress, which is always word final except in the case of a few stress-attracting prefixes (the inverse \ipa{wɣɯ́--}, the negative testimonial \ipa{mɯ́j--}, and the comitative \ipa{kɤ́--}). Verb suffixes are always unstressed (and can be realized with voiceless vowels), and stress in verb forms are either on the stress-attracting prefixes or on the last stem syllable.

Japhug dialects vary as to their exact number of vowels. The Kamnyu dialect has eight vowel phonemes \ipa{a},  \ipa{e},  \ipa{i},  \ipa{o},  \ipa{u},   \ipa{ɤ},  \ipa{ɯ} and \ipa{y}, the latter only occurring in the word \ipa{qaɟy} `fish' and verbs derived from it and in Chinese loanwords. 

Partial reduplication in Japhug provides important insight into syllabic structure (\citealt{jacques07redupl}). When partial reduplication is applied to a syllable, the rhyme of the replicated syllable is changed to \ipa{ɯ} in the replicant.
 
Some clusters are affected by partial reduplication:   when the last consonant  of a cluster is one of the non-nasal sonorants (\ipa{r}, \ipa{l}, \ipa{j}, \ipa{w}, \ipa{ɣ} or \ipa{ʁ}), and the preceding consonant is neither a sonorant nor a sibilant fricative, the sonorant is deleted, as in example \ref{ex:medial.r}. 
 
 \begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:medial.r}
\glt \ipa{praʁ} `cut, break'$\rightarrow$ \ipa{pɯ-praʁ}
\end{exe}

When the penultimate consonant of the cluster is a sonorant   and the last consonant is a non-nasal sonorant which is not a glide (\ipa{r}, \ipa{l}, \ipa{ɣ} or \ipa{ʁ}), this last consonant  is not deleted. 

 \begin{exe}
\ex  \label{ex:initial.r}
\glt \ipa{βraʁ} `attach' $\rightarrow$ \ipa{βrɯ-βraʁ}
\end{exe}
 
The contrast between \ref{ex:medial.r} and \ref{ex:initial.r} shows that the \ipa{r} in these cluster does not have the same phonological status: in the second case, it forms a phonological constituent with the rhyme.



\section{Verbal morphology}

\subsection{Verb stems}

Japhug verbs present stem alternations determined by TAM and person/number marking. 

Verbs have at most three distinct stems, which we designate as stem 1, stem 2 and stem 3 following \citet{jackson00sidaba}. Stem 1 is the default stem. Stem 2 appears only in the perfective and past imperfective forms. It is very residual in Japhug, attested only in a limited number of verbs indicated in Table \ref{tab:stem2}.


 \begin{table} 
\caption{Stem 2 alternation in Japhug Rgyalrong} \label{tab:stem2} \centering
\begin{tabular}{llllll}
\toprule
Stem 1 & meaning &Stem 2 \\
\midrule
\ipa{ɕe}& to go (vi)&  \ipa{ari} \\
\ipa{sɯxɕe}& to send (vt)  &\ipa{sɤɣri} \\
\ipa{ɣi}& to come (vi)  &\ipa{ɣe} \\
\ipa{ti}& to say (vt)  &\ipa{tɯt} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Stem 3 in Japhug on the other hand is fully productive, and always appears in the forms \textsc{1sg}$\rightarrow$3, \textsc{2sg}$\rightarrow$3 and \textsc{3sg}$\rightarrow$3' of non-past TAM categories (factual, imperfective, testimonial, present) for transitive verbs. Stem 3 does not appear in verb forms with the inverse marker (see below). Intransitive verbs lack stem 3 alternation.

Table \ref{tab:stem3} presents all Stem 3 alternations attested in various Japhug dialects. The vowel alternation applies to the last vowel (in open syllables only) of the verb stem. In the case of verb stems ending in  \ipa{--u} and  \ipa{--ɯ}, some Japhug dialects allow two possible alternations, some verbs displaying vowel fronting and other addition of the \ipa{--m} suffixal element (as in Datshang, see \citealt{linluo03}), while other dialects have generalized vowel fronting.

 \begin{table} 
\caption{Stem 3 alternation in Japhug Rgyalrong} \label{tab:stem3} \centering
\begin{tabular}{llllll}
\toprule
Stem 1 & Stem 3& type \\
\midrule
 \ipa{--a} & \ipa{--e} & vowel fronting\\
 \ipa{--u} & \ipa{--e} & vowel fronting\\
\ipa{--u} & \ipa{--ɤm} & \ipa{--m} \\
\ipa{--ɯ} & \ipa{--i} & vowel fronting\\
\ipa{--ɯ} & \ipa{--ɯm} & \ipa{--m}\\
\ipa{--o} & \ipa{--ɤm} & \ipa{--m} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}




\subsection{Directional prefixes}
All finite verb forms except the \textsc{factual} have directional prefixes belonging to one of the four series in Table \ref{tab:directional} (some Japhug dialects have \ipa{co--} instead of \ipa{pjɤ--} in series D for the `down' prefix, see \citealt{linluo03}). The non-periphrastic TAM categories are indicated in Table \ref{tab:finite.forms}. Some of these categories require one particular directional prefix (testimonial, present, past imperfective, evidential imperfective). The other TAM categories only require a prefix of either set A, B, C or D, but the direction depends on the verb.

Most verbs have one intrinsic direction which is lexically determined, and used in the perfective, imperfective, evidential, irrealis and imperative. For instance, the verb \ipa{ndza} `eat' selects the `up' series of directional prefixes for all its forms: \textbf{perfective} \textsc{1sg$\rightarrow$3sg} \ipa{tɤ-ndza-t-a} `I ate it', \textbf{imperfective} (with stem 3) \ipa{tu-ndze} `He eats it', \textbf{perfective} \textsc{3sg$\rightarrow$3'} \ipa{ta-ndza} `He ate it' and \textbf{evidential} \ipa{to-ndza} `He ate it'. 

In addition to the directional prefixes, two additional TAM markers appear in specific forms. First, the past \ipa{--t} suffix (\ipa{--z} in some dialects of Japhug)in the \textsc{1sg}$\rightarrow$3 and \textsc{2sg}$\rightarrow$3 forms of transitive verbs whose last stem syllable is an open syllable as \ipa{tɤ-ndza-t-a} \textsc{pfv}-eat-\textsc{pst-1sg} `I ate it'. Second, the evidential circumfix \ipa{kɯ--...-ci} is required whenever set D directional prefixes are used with a verb whose stem begins in \ipa{a--}, including verb with the progressive prefix \ipa{asɯ--} (see below). For instance, the evidential form of the verb \ipa{anbaʁ} `hide' is \ipa{ko-kɯ-ɤnbaʁ-ci} \textsc{evd-evd}-hide-\textsc{evd} `he hid'.

\end{tabular}}
\end{table}


Verbs of motion and some verbs of concrete action can be associated with all seven series of prefixes to indicate the direction of the motion. The  `no direction' series of prefixes only occurs with motion verbs. 

\begin{table}
\caption{Finite verb categories in Japhug Rgyalrong} \label{tab:finite.forms} \centering
\begin{tabular}{lllllll}
\toprule
&	&	stem&	prefixes\\
\midrule
factual&	\textsc{fact} &	1 or 3&	no prefix\\
imperfective&	\textsc{ipfv} &	1 or 3&	B\\
perfective&	\textsc{pfv} &	2&	A or C\\
past imperfective&	\textsc{pst.ipfv} &	2&	\ipa{pɯ--}\\
evidential&	\textsc{evd} &	1&	D\\
evidential imperfective&	\textsc{evd.ipfv} &	1&	\ipa{pjɤ--}\\
testimonial&	\textsc{testim} &	1 or 3&	\ipa{ɲɯ--}\\

irrealis&	\textsc{irr} &	1 or 3&	\ipa{a--} + A\\
imperative&	\textsc{imp} &	1 or 3&	A\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The simple TAM categories in Table \ref{tab:finite.forms} can be combined with other TAM markers such as the conative \ipa{ji--} and the progressive \ipa{asɯ--}/\ipa{az--}. The prefix \ipa{asɯ--} can only be used with transitive verbs. Verbs prefixed with \ipa{asɯ--} lose some transitivity features, such as stem alternation and past \ipa{-t-} suffix, but can still take inverse and 1$\rightarrow$2 / 2$\rightarrow$1 markers. The inverse prefix is \textit{infixed} within the progressive prefix, as in the form \ipa{pjɤ-kɯ-ɤ́<wɣ>z-nɤjo-ci} \textsc{evd.ipfv-evd-prog<inv>}-wait.for-\textsc{evd} `he was waiting for him'.

In addition, periphrastic TAM categories, combining simple verb forms with the copula \ipa{ŋu} `be', \ipa{maʁ} `not be' or \ipa{ɕti} `be (affirmative)' are also attested. The most common periphrastic tenses are the periphrastic past imperfective and periphrastic evidential imperfective, built by combining the imperfective form of the verb with the past imperfective \ipa{pɯ-ŋu} and evidential imperfective \ipa{pjɤ-ŋu} of the copula. Most dynamic verbs cannot be used in the simple past and evidential imperfective in Japhug (see \citealt{lin11direction}) and periphrastic tenses are required as in example \ref{ex:evd.ipfv.periphrastic}: directly combining the prefix \ipa{pjɤ--} with the stem of the verb `eat' results  in an incorrect form. The past and evidential imperfective of dynamic verbs is attested only in counterfactual and in combination with the progressive \ipa{asɯ--} (see \citealt[297-301]{jacques14linking}).\footnote{The presence of the circumfix \ipa{kɯ--...-ci} in example \ref{ex:evd.ipfv.prog} is explained in the previous section.}

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:evd.ipfv.periphrastic}
\gll
\ipa{tu-ndze} \ipa{pjɤ-ŋu} \\
 \textsc{ipfv}-eat[III] \textsc{evd.ipfv}-be \\
\glt He was eating it. / He used to eat it.
\ex \label{ex:evd.ipfv.prog}
\gll
 \ipa{pjɤ-kɯ-ɤsɯ-ndza-ci} \\
 \textsc{evd.ipfv-evd-prog}-eat-\textsc{evd} \\
\glt He was eating it.
\end{exe}



\subsection{Person marking}
Japhug person marking is encoded by a series of prefixes and suffixes, in addition to stem 1 / Stem 3 alternations in the case of transitive verbs.

Table \ref{tab:japhug.tr} presents the regular transitive and intransitive verbal paradigms in Japhug in the \textsc{factual}. The symbols \siga{} and \sigc{} represent Stem 1 and Stem 3 respectively. The affixes found in the intransitive paradigm (the second person \ipa{tɯ--} and the suffixes) also appear in the transitive paradigm, in addition to portmanteau prefixes (\ipa{kɯ--} and \ipa{ta--} for the local scenarios 2$\rightarrow$1 and 1$\rightarrow$2) and the inverse prefix \ipa{wɣɯ--} which is obligatory in 3$\rightarrow$1 and 3$\rightarrow$2 mixed scenario and cannot occur in local and 1$\rightarrow$3 and 2$\rightarrow$3 scenarios. When both arguments are third person, the use of the inverse is determined by semantic and pragmatic factors (see \citealt{jacques10inverse}).

\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

The sensory existential copulas \ipa{ɣɤʑu} `exist' and \ipa{maŋe} `not exist' are extremely irregular. They cannot be used with directional prefixes, unlike nearly all other verbs, cannot be nominalized, and have infixed forms for the second person \ipa{ɣɤtɤʑu} `you are there' and \ipa{mataŋe} `you are not there'.

\subsection{Derivation}
Japhug a a very rich system of derivations, including voice markers, denominal and deideophonic prefixes. Only the former will be discussed here.

\subsubsection{Argument demotion}
In Japhug, non-overt arguments in a sentence are always construed as being definite. To express indefinite agent or patient, several strategies are possible, including indefinite pronouns such as \ipa{tʰɯci} `something', generic person or argument-demoting voice markers.

Japhug has a wide array of argument-demoting prefixes, including passive \ipa{a--}, anticausative, antipassive \ipa{sɤ--} and \ipa{rɤ--} and deexperiencer \ipa{sɤ--} (see \citealt{jacques12demotion}). The antipassive prefixes have been grammaticalized from denominal prefixes (\citealt{jacques14antipassive}).

The  \ipa{a--} prefix is an agentless passive, that converts a transitive verb into an intransitive one whose S corresponds to the P of the base verb. The original A cannot be expressed, but is semantically recoverable, as in \ref{ex:passive} with the light verb construction \ipa{sɤcɯ --lɤt} `lock'. 

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:passive}
\gll 
\ipa{ɯ-ŋgɯ} 	\ipa{lɤ-ɣi} 	\ipa{jɤɣ} 	\ipa{ma} 	\ipa{sɤcɯ} 	\ipa{mɤ-a-lɤt} \\
\textsc{3sg}-inside \textsc{imp:upstream}-come  be.possible:\textsc{fact} because key \textsc{neg-pass}-throw:\textsc{fact} \\
\glt Come in, (the door) is not locked.
\end{exe}

The anticausative is distinct from the agentless passive in that the action is construed as having occurred spontaneously without any agent. Only 24 pairs of verbs with anticausative derivation have been found in Japhug (see some examples in Table \ref{tab:anticausative}). Note the presence of the verb \ipa{χtɤr} `spill' borrowed from Tibetan \ipa{gtor} (same meaning): this verb shows that the direction of derivation is from transitive to intransitive, not the other way round, since the corresponding intransitive verb \ipa{ʁndɤr} `be spilled' cannot be a Tibetan borrowing.


\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Examples of anticausative in Japhug}\label{tab:anticausative}
\begin{tabular}{lllllllll} \toprule
basic verb  & &derived  verb &\\
\midrule
\ipa{ftʂi}  &	to melt (vt)	&		\ipa{ndʐi}  &	to melt (vi)		\\
\ipa{kio}  &	to cause to drop	&		\ipa{ŋgio}  &	to slip		\\
\ipa{prɤt}  &	to break	&		\ipa{mbrɤt}  &		to be broken	\\
\ipa{χtɤr}  &	 to spill	&		\ipa{ʁndɤr}  &		to be spilled	\\
\ipa{tʂaβ}  &	to cause to roll	&		\ipa{ndʐaβ}  &	to roll (vi)		\\
   \ipa{cɯ}  &	 to open 	&		\ipa{ɲɟɯ}  &	 to be opened	 	\\ 
 \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The semantic difference with the passive can be illustrated with \ipa{pjɤ-mbrɤt} \textsc{evd-anticaus}:break `it broke (of a rope)' vs \ipa{pjɤ-kɯ-ɤ-prɤt-ci} \textsc{evd-evd-pass-break}-\textsc{evd}`(someone) broke it'.

There are two antipassive prefixes \ipa{rɤ--} and \ipa{sɤ--}, which convert a transitive verb into an intransitive one whose S corresponds to the A of the base verb. The prefix \ipa{rɤ--} is used in two cases: when the P of the base verb designates a non-human (\ipa{rɤt} `write (tr)' $\rightarrow$ \ipa{rɤ-rɤt} `write (intr)', \ipa{ɕar} `search, look for (tr)' $\rightarrow$ \ipa{rɤ-ɕar} `look for things (intr)') or in the case of ditransitive verbs, even when the P corresponds to the (human) recipient (\ipa{mbi} `give X to' $\rightarrow$ \ipa{rɤmbi} `give X to someone'). The antipassive \ipa{sɤ--} derives either a dynamic verb whose demoted argument is necessarily human (\ipa{sɤ-ɕar} `look for people (intr)') or a stative verb, whose demoted P can be either human or non-human (\ipa{sat} `kill' $\rightarrow$ \ipa{sɤ-sat} `have a killing power, be deadly'). 

A historically related derivation is the deexperiencer \ipa{sɤ--}, which derives a stative verb from any stative verb, changing an experiencer S into the stimulus (\ipa{ŋgio} `slip' $\rightarrow$ \ipa{sɤ-ŋgio} `be slippery').

\subsubsection{Incorporation}
Japhug has an incorporation-like construction in which noun-verb nominal compounds are turned into verbs by means of a denominal prefix (\citealt{jacques12incorp}). For instance, from the noun \ipa{cɯ} `stone' and the verb\ipa{pʰɯt} `pluck, take out' one can derive an action nominal    \ipa{cɯpʰɯt} `clearing the stones', which can in turn be made into an incorporating verb by denominal derivation  \ipa{ɣɯ-cɯpʰɯt } `take out stones (out of the field)'.

\begin{exe}   
\ex
\begin{xlist}[(ii)]
\exi{(i)} 
\gll     \ipa{cɯ-pʰɯt} \ipa{nɯ-βzu-t-a}  \\
  stone-clearing \textsc{pfv}-do-\textsc{pst}-\textsc{1sg} \\
\exi{(ii)} 
\gll     \ipa{nɯ-ɣɯ-cɯ-pʰɯt-a}  \\
  \textsc{pfv-denominal}-stone-take.out-\textsc{1sg} \\
\exi{(iii)} 
\gll     \ipa{cɯ} \ipa{nɯ-pʰɯt-a}  \\
  stone \textsc{pfv}-take.out-\textsc{1sg} \\
  \end{xlist}
 \glt   I cleared the stones (from the field). 
\end{exe}   

The three constructions above have a slightly different meaning: the compound action nominal with light verb construction (i) implies that the action took considerable time, while the incorporating construction (ii) cannot be used if the action refers to specific stones that have been previously mentioned in discourse, contrary  to (iii).

\subsubsection{Causative}
There are two causative prefixes in Japhug, \ipa{sɯ--} and \ipa{ɣɤ--}. 

The causative   \ipa{sɯ--} prefix is extremely productive, and can be added to nearly any verb, including recent borrowings from Tibetan and Chinese. It presents  considerable allomorphy, and numerous irregular forms. It has three regular allomorphs \ipa{sɯ-}, \ipa{sɯɣ-} and \ipa{z-} depending on the following element. The \ipa{z-} allomorph appears before all prefixes in sonorant initial. It expresses very broad causative meanings, including indirect causative (including by one's inaction), permissive (`allow to') and is also (optionally) used with  instruments marked in the ergative as in \ref{ex:caus.instrument}.


\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:caus.instrument}
\gll  \ipa{ɯ-χto} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{mbrɯtɕɯ} 	\ipa{kɯ} 	\ipa{kú-wɣ-sɯ-rkhe}  \\
\textsc{3sg.poss}-slit \textsc{dem} knife \textsc{erg}  \textsc{ipfv-inv-cause}-carve \\
 \glt  The slit is carved with a knife. (Colored belts 13)
\end{exe} 

Causative verbs with irregular allomorphs such as \ipa{jtsʰi} `give to drink'  from \ipa{tsʰi} `drink' generally have unpredictable semantics. The regular form is always possible at least to express an action with an instrument (\ipa{sɯ-tsʰi} `drink with').

When the causative \ipa{sɯ--} is applied to a transitive verb, whenever the causee or the patient is first or second person, it is always encoded on the verb, resulting in ambiguous forms. As an example, the causative of \ipa{qur} ``to help''  \ipa{sɯ-qur} can have two meanings in specific cases (\ref{ex:caus:show.2>3>1}).

\begin{exe} 
\ex \label{ex:caus:show.2>3>1}
\gll   \ipa{tɤ-kɯ-sɯ-qur-a-ndʑi}  \\
 \textsc{pfv-2$\rightarrow$1-caus}-help-\textsc{1sg-du}  \\
 \glt  You_d caused me to help him. OR You_d caused him to help me. 
\end{exe} 

The causative \ipa{ɣɤ--} is more restricted, and can only occur with some stative verbs. There is a slight semantic contrast between \ipa{sɯ--} and \ipa{ɣɤ--} in Japhug: in the case of some stative verbs, the former indicates a change of state, while the latter expresses a increase of degree (see also \citealt{jackson06paisheng} about Tshobdun). Example \ref{ex:ngolo-tAjko}  illustrates the use of \ipa{sɯ--} to express a change of state. Using \ipa{pjɯ-ɣɤ-tɕur} (\textsc{ipfv-caus}-be.sour) with the prefix \ipa{ɣɤ--} instead would mean `make it sourer' (it would imply that the leaves were already sour in the first place).

 \begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:ngolo-tAjko}
\gll
\ipa{tɕe} 	\ipa{tɤjko} 	\ipa{mɯ-tɤ-tɕur} 	\ipa{tɕe,} 	\ipa{ɴɢolo} 	\ipa{ɯ-mat} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{ɲɯ́-wɣ-phɯt} 	\ipa{tɕe,} 	\ipa{tɕe} 	\ipa{tɤrca} 	\ipa{pjɯ́-wɣ-ɣɤla} 	\ipa{tɕe,} 	\ipa{tɕe} 	\ipa{tɤjko} 	\ipa{pjɯ-sɯɣ-tɕur} 	\ipa{cha.} \\ 
\textsc{lnk} pickled.turnip.leaves \textsc{neg-pfv}-be.sour \textsc{lnk} tree.sp \textsc{3sg.poss}-fruit \textsc{dem} ipfv-inv-pluck \textsc{lnk} \textsc{lnk} together \textsc{ipfv-inv}-soak \textsc{lnk} \textsc{lnk}  pickled.turnip.leaves \textsc{ipfv-caus}-be.sour  can:\textsc{fact} \\
 \glt When the pickled turnip leaves are not sour, one picks \ipa{ɴɢolo} fruit and soaks it with them, and it can make the turnip leaves sour.   (\ipa{ɴɢolo} 27)
   \end{exe}

\subsubsection{Applicative and tropative}
In addition to the causative, Japhug has two valency-increasing voice derivation, the applicative \ipa{nɯ--} / \ipa{nɯɣ--} and the tropative \ipa{nɤ--} /\ipa{nɤɣ--} (\citealt{jacques13tropative}).

The applicative converts an intransitive verb into a transitive one whose A corresponds to the S of the base verb and whose P can be either a stimulus or a recipient (for instance \ipa{mu} `be afraid' $\rightarrow$\ipa{nɯɣ-mu} `be afraid of'). 

The tropative is an extremely productive derivation that can be applied to all stative verbs describing a quality (ie, it is a criterion for defining an adjective subclass among stative verbs), deriving a transitive whose P corresponds to the S of the base verb (like a causative) but whose A is an experiencer, not an agent. The tropative verb has the meaning `to find / consider to be', thus \ipa{xtɕi} `be small' $\rightarrow$ \ipa{nɤ-xtɕi} `to find small'.

\subsubsection{Other voice markers}
In addition to the voice markers described above, Japhug also has a reflexive \ipa{ʑɣɤ--} distinct from the reciprocal (expressed by combining the prefix \ipa{a--} with a partially reduplicated verb stem).

We also find three verbal derivations with modal meanings: the abilitative \ipa{sɯ--/z--} (expressing the meaning `be able to X', \ipa{nɤɕqa} `bear' $\rightarrow$ \ipa{z-nɤɕqa} `be able to bear)', the stative facilitative \ipa{ɣɤ--} (\ipa{wxti} `be big' $\rightarrow$ \ipa{ɣɤ-wxti} `grow big easily') and the passive facilitative \ipa{nɯɣɯ--} (\ipa{ntɕʰoz} `use' $\rightarrow$\ipa{nɯɣɯ-ntɕʰoz} `be easy to use').
   
\subsection{Autobenefactive-spontaneous}

The autobenefactive-spontaneous \ipa{nɯ--} prefix expresses a wide range of meanings. First, it is used to express that the S/A is affected by the action; it appears in particular with transitive verbs when the P is a body part of or belongs to the S/A (\ref{ex:pWnWXtCi}).

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:pWnWXtCi}
\gll 
\ipa{nɤ-ku} 	\ipa{pɯ-nɯ-χtɕi} \\
\textsc{2sg.poss}-head \textsc{imp-auto}-wash \\
\glt Wash your head.
\end{exe}

The prefix \ipa{nɯ--} can also be used to express involuntary actions, as in \ref{ex:panWClWG}.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:panWClWG}
\gll \ipa{ɯ-qom} 	\ipa{ci} 	\ipa{pa-nɯ-ɕlɯɣ} 	\ipa{ɲɯ-ŋu,} \\
\textsc{3sg.poss}-tear \textsc{indef} \textsc{pfv:3$\rightarrow$3'-auto}-drop \textsc{testim}-be \\
\glt She shed a tear (unvoluntarily).(Kunbzang 228)
\end{exe}


The prefix \ipa{nɯ--} is also used to express an action occurring by itself, without exterior agent/causer, even if the action is voluntary and controllable, as in \ref{ex:pjWnWmtsaRa}.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:pjWnWmtsaRa}
\gll 
\ipa{aʑo} 	\ipa{pjɯ-kɯ-ɣɤrat-a-nɯ} 	\ipa{mɤ-ra} 	\ipa{ma} 	\ipa{aʑo} 	\ipa{pjɯ-nɯ-mtsaʁ-a} 	\ipa{jɤɣ} \\
\textsc{1sg} \textsc{ipfv:down}-2$\rightarrow$1-throw-\textsc{1sg-pl} \textsc{neg-}need:\textsc{fact} because \textsc{1sg} \textsc{neg-ipfv:down-auto}-jump-\textsc{1sg} be.possible:\textsc{fact} \\
\glt You don't need to throw me in there, I will jump of my own free will.
\end{exe}

The autobenefactive-spontaneous prefix has no influence on the verb transitivity.

\subsection{Associated motion}
Japhug has two associated motion prefixes \ipa{ɕɯ--} and \ipa{ɣɯ--} expressing a motion taking place before the action expressed by the verb to which the prefixes are attached 
(\citealt{jacques13harmonization}). The translocative \ipa{ɕɯ--} and the cislocative \ipa{ɣɯ--} respectively express the meaning `go to ..., go and ...' or `come to..., come and ...', as in example \ref{ex:cisloc}.


\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:cisloc}
\gll
\ipa{tɤrɤku} 	\ipa{kɯ-fse} 	\ipa{ɣɯ-tu-ndze} 	\ipa{nɯra} 	\ipa{mɤ-ŋgrɤl.} \\
crops \textsc{nmlz}:S-be.like \textsc{cisloc-ipfv}-eat[III] \textsc{dem:pl} \textsc{neg-}be.usually.the.case:\textsc{fact} \\
\glt It does not come to eat crops and things like that.
\end{exe}

These prefixes are semantically close to the motion verb construction with \ipa{ɕe} `go' and \ipa{ɣi} `come' and a complement with the verb in the S/A nominalization form. A crucial difference, however, can be found in the perfective:  motion verb constructions such as \ref{ex:motion.verb} imply that the motion event has taken place, but do not specify whether the action of the complement clause has taken place or not. Using the associated motion form \ipa{ɣɯ-tɤ-tɯ-nɤma-t} instead would mean `What have you done ? (after coming here)'.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:motion.verb}
\gll
\ipa{tɕʰi} 	\ipa{ɯ-kɯ-nɤma} 	\ipa{jɤ-tɯ-ɣe?} \\
what \textsc{3sg-nmlz:}S/A-do \textsc{pfv-2}-come[II] \\
\glt What have you come to do?
\end{exe}
%retrouver l'exemple


With causative verbs, the associated motion can refer either to the motion of the causer or that of the causee as in example \ref{ex:assoc.motion2}.

  \begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:assoc.motion2}
\gll
\ipa{tɕe} 	\ipa{kupa} 	\ipa{chu} 	\ipa{nɯra} 	\ipa{athi} 	\ipa{pɕoʁ} 	\ipa{nɯra,} 	\ipa{ɯ-pɕi} 	\ipa{nɯra} 	\ipa{kɯ} 	\ipa{kɯreri} 	\ipa{ɣɯ-chɯ-sɯ-χtɯ-nɯ} 	\ipa{ŋu.}  \\
\textsc{lnk} Chinese \textsc{loc} \textsc{dem:pl} downstream direction \textsc{dem:pl} \textsc{3sg}-outside  \textsc{dem:pl}  \textsc{erg} here \textsc{cisloc-ipfv:downstream-caus}-buy-\textsc{pl} be:\textsc{fact} \\
\glt People from the Chinese areas, people from outside send people to come here to buy (matsutake and sell them in the areas downstream). (Matsutake 58)
  \end{exe} 


\subsection{Nominalization and other non-finite forms}

Japhug has a rich set of non-finite verb forms: participles, action nominalizer, infinitives and converbs. These forms have in common the facts that (i) they can only mark person by means of possessive prefixes like nouns, cannot take the inverse prefix, and cannot encode two arguments in the case of transitive verbs (ii) they cannot use stem 3 (iii) they cannot serve as the predicate of a main clause.

There are three participles in Japhug: the S/A-participle \ipa{kɯ--}, the P-participle \ipa{kɤ--} and the oblique participle \ipa{sɤ--}. In the case of transitive verbs, the S/A-participle takes a possessive prefix (see Table \ref{tab:pronoun}) coreferent with the P (\ipa{ndza} `eat' $\rightarrow$ \ipa{ɯ_i-kɯ-ndza} `the one who eats it_i'), while the P-participle optionally takes a possessive prefix coreferent with the A (\ipa{ɯ_i-kɤ-ndza} `what he/it_i eats'). The oblique participle \ipa{sɤ--} can refer to  the instrument, the place, time or recipient of an action (see the section on relatives).

The participles can be used with negation and directional prefixes (only set A and B); participles with perfective directional prefixes take stem 2 if they have a distinct stem.

In addition, Japhug verbs have infinitives in \ipa{kɤ--} (for dynamic verbs allowing an animate argument) or \ipa{kɯ--} (for intransitive stative verbs or verbs only used with inanimate arguments). While the infinitives are superficially similar to the S/A- and P-participles, their morphology and uses are different. They cannot take any possessive prefix, and in the case of intransitive dynamic verbs, the forms in \ipa{kɤ--}. In addition, in some complements clauses, transitive verbs have a bare infinitive made of the bare stem 1 with a possessive prefix coreferent with the P (\citealt{jacques14antipassive}).

Finally, we find three converbs which are used in various clause linking constructions (see \citealt{jacques14linking}). First, the perfective converb is built by combining a set B directional prefix (normally restricted to imperfective tenses!),  the prefix \ipa{--tɯ--} and the verb stem 1, as in \ipa{mto} `see' $\rightarrow$ \ipa{pjɯ-tɯ-mto} `as soon as X saw Y'; it cannot receive any person marking. Second, the gerundive is made of the prefix \ipa{sɤ--} and a reduplicated verb stem, as in \ipa{mu} `be afraid' $\rightarrow$ \ipa{sɤ-mɯ\textasciitilde{}mu} `while being afraid'. Third, the purposive converb comprises a possessive prefix coreferent with any core argument (A, P or S), a negative prefix (optional), a set B directional prefix, the prefix \ipa{sɤ--} and a partially reduplication verb stem 1, as in \ipa{jmɯt} `forget' $\rightarrow$ \ipa{ɯ-mɤ-ɲɯ-sɤ-jmɯ\textasciitilde{}jmɯt} `in order not to forget'.

\subsection{Generic person}
Apart from argument-demoting voice prefixes, another way of expressing indefinite arguments in Japhug is generic person marking. It is available only for generic human referents, not for inanimates or animals.

This type of person marking follows an ergative alignment: generic S and P arguments are marked with the prefix \ipa{kɯ--} (see examples \ref{ex:pWkWNu} and \ref{ex:kukWnWfse}) while generic A argument is marked with the inverse prefix \ipa{wɣ--} (\ref{ex:tuwGndza.sna}; the verb \ipa{ti} `` say' is irregular in that its generic A form takes the \ipa{kɯ--} prefix).  Verbs with generic person markers cannot take any other person or number markers.


\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:pWkWNu}
\gll
\ipa{tɕeri} 	\ipa{tɤpɤtso} 	\ipa{pɯ-kɯ-ŋu} 	\ipa{tɕe,} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{kɤ-ndza} 	\ipa{wuma} 	\ipa{ʑo} 	\ipa{pɯ-kɯ-rga.} \\

\end{exe}

\begin{exe}

people \textsc{erg} \textsc{ipfv-inv}-eat \textsc{neg-}be.fine:\textsc{fact} \\
\glt People cannot eat it. (\ipa{khɯrtshɤz}, 39)
\end{exe}

\subsection{Transitivity}
The single most important feature in Japhug verbal morphology is transitivity. As seen above, transitive verbs differ from intransitive verbs in several ways: the S/A-participle can take a possessive prefix coreferent with the P, the perfective third person forms take set C as directional prefixes (or the inverse prefix), and verbs whose base stem is in an open syllable have the past \ipa{-t-} suffix in \textsc{1sg$\rightarrow$3} and \textsc{2sg$\rightarrow$3} in past forms and stem 3 alternation in non-past forms in some cases.

There is never any ambiguity as to whether a particular verb is morphologically  transitive or intransitive, but some verbs, such as \ipa{taʁ} `weave' or \ipa{mɯrkɯ} `steal' are labile and can be conjugated either transitively or intransitively (\citealt{jacques12demotion}). All labile verbs in Japhug are A-preserving; there are no examples of P-preserving lability.

There is a class of semi-transitive verbs, such as \ipa{rga} `like' or \ipa{aro} `have, own' that are morphologically intransitive but present some syntactic transitivity. While their finite conjugation is identical to that of intransitive verbs, and while their S does not take ergative marking, they do have P-participles in \ipa{kɤ--} and thus have an object-like argument that can be relativized exactly in the same way as the P of a transitive verb. This argument however, even if first or second person, cannot be marked in the verb morphology.

Ditransitive verbs can be either secundative (with $R=P$, like \ipa{mbi} `give'), indirective ($T=P$, as \ipa{tʰu} `ask') or both (causative verbs deriving from transitive base verbs) from the point of view of person marking on the verb. No more than two arguments can be encoded by verbal morphology. The noun phrases corresponding to recipients of indirective verbs receive dative flagging by means of the relator nouns \ipa{ɯ-ɕki} or \ipa{ɯ-pʰe}, but cannot be marked on the verb, even if first or second person.

The relativization patterns however slightly differ from argument indexation on the verb.
In the case of secundative verbs, both the R and the T of secundative verbs are relativizable like the P, even though only the R is indexed on the verb. As for indirective verbs, the R is relativized by means of the oblique participle (see the section on relativization).

\section{Nominal morphology}
Japhug nouns can be divided in three sub-classes: simple nouns, inalienably possessed nouns and nouns with numeral prefixes (classifiers). Only the first two classes are discussed in this sketch. 

The same set of possessive prefixes (see Table \ref{tab:pronoun}) is used for all nouns, but inalienably possessed nouns cannot be used on their own without one of these prefixes. When there is no definite possessor, the indefinite possessive prefixes \ipa{tɤ--} or \ipa{tɯ--} are used. It is the citation form of inalienably possessed nouns (\ipa{tɤ-lu} `milk', \ipa{tɯ-ŋga} `clothes', \ipa{tɤ-rpɯ} `uncle', \ipa{tɯ-ci} `water'). The choice of the prefix \ipa{tɤ--} vs \ipa{tɯ--} is lexically determined.  When a specific possessor is present, the indefinite prefix is replaced by the appropriate possessive prefix (\ipa{ɯ-lu} `her/its milk (from her nipple)', \ipa{a-ŋga} `my clothes', \ipa{nɤ-rpɯ} `your uncle', \ipa{ɯ-ci} `its juice'). It is possible to turn an inalienably possessor noun into an alienably possessed one by prefixing definite possessive prefix to the indefinite one (\ipa{ɯ-tɤ-lu} `his milk (to drink)', \ipa{ɯ-tɯ-ci} `its water (of irrigated water, to a plant)'). Simple nouns cannot take indefinite possessive prefixes.


\begin{table}[H] \centering
\caption{Pronouns and possessive prefixes }\label{tab:pronoun}
\begin{tabular}{lllllllll} 
\toprule
 Free pronoun & Prefix & Person\\
\midrule
 \ipa{aʑo},    \ipa{ɤj} &	\ipa{a--}  &		1\textsc{sg} \\
\ipa{nɤʑo},  \ipa{nɤj} &	\ipa{nɤ--}  &			2\textsc{sg}\\
\ipa{ɯʑo}  &	\ipa{ɯ--}  &			3\textsc{sg}\\
\midrule
\ipa{tɕiʑo}  &	\ipa{tɕi--}  &			1\textsc{du} \\
\ipa{ndʑiʑo}  &	\ipa{ndʑi--}  &		2\textsc{du} \\	
\ipa{ʑɤni}  &	\ipa{ndʑi--}  &		3\textsc{du} \\	
\midrule
\ipa{iʑo}, \ipa{iʑora},   \ipa{iʑɤra}   &	\ipa{i--}  &			1\textsc{pl} \\
\ipa{nɯʑo}, \ipa{nɯʑora},   \ipa{nɯʑɤra}  &	\ipa{nɯ--}  &			2\textsc{pl} \\
\ipa{ʑara}  &	\ipa{nɯ--}  &			3\textsc{pl} \\
\midrule
&  \ipa{tɯ--},  \ipa{tɤ--} & indefinite \\
\ipa{tɯʑo} & \ipa{tɯ--}   &  generic\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The indefinite possessive prefixes should not be confused with the generic possessive prefix \ipa{tɯ--}, which can be added to any noun, and which is coreferent with the argument marked with generic marking on the verb, as in example \ref{ex:tWrpW}. Note also that inalienably possessed nouns that select the indefinite possessive prefix \ipa{tɤ--} have \ipa{tɯ--} instead when the possessor is generic (\ipa{tɤ-rpɯ} `an uncle' vs \ipa{tɯ-rpɯ} `one's uncle').

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:tWrpW}
\gll
 \ipa{tɯ-rpɯ} 	\ipa{ɯ-rɟit} 	\ipa{ɯ-ɕki} 	\ipa{tɕe} 	\ipa{tɕe} 	``\ipa{a-rpɯ} \ipa{a-ɬaʁ}" 	\ipa{tu-kɯ-ti} 	\ipa{ŋu.} \\
\textsc{genr.poss}-uncle \textsc{3sg.poss}-offspring \textsc{3sg-dat} \textsc{lnk} \textsc{lnk} \textsc{1sg.poss}-uncle \textsc{1sg.poss}-aunt \textsc{ipfv-genr}-say  be:\textsc{fact} \\
\glt One has to say ``my maternal uncle, my maternal aunt" to one's maternal uncle's sons and daughters. (Kinship, 69)
\end{exe}

Some possessed nouns have restrictions on the interpretation of the possessor. Thus, the possessive prefix of the noun \ipa{tɤ-pɤro} `present' can only refer to the person giving the present, never the recipient: \ipa{a-pɤro} \textsc{1sg.poss}-\textit{present} can only mean `my present (to him, to you etc)' not `the present (you, he gave) me'.

Japhug has a very rich denominal morphology, and also has a productive comitative adverb derivation with the prefix \ipa{kɤɣɯ--} or \ipa{kɤ́--} and reduplicated noun stem, as in \ipa{tɤ-rtaʁ} `branch' $\rightarrow$ \ipa{kɤɣɯrtɯrtaʁ} `with branches'. These adverbs probably originate historically from the S-participle of denominal propriety verbs with the prefix \ipa{aɣɯ--} (\ipa{tɤ-rtaʁ} `branch' $\rightarrow$ \ipa{aɣɯrtɯrtaʁ} `have many branches').

\section{The noun phrase} 
Noun phrases in Japhug follow the general template \ref{ex:noun.template}, as illustrated by examples \ref{ex:atCW.XsWm} and \ref{ex:tCheme.XsWm}.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:noun.template}
\glt \textsc{dem-noun^{modifier}-noun^{head}-adj-num-dem}
\end{exe}

The demonstratives \ipa{ki} `this' and \ipa{nɯ} `that' can either appear in the beginning or the end of the noun phrase, or be repeated at both ends.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:atCW.XsWm}
\gll
\ipa{ki} 	\ipa{a-tɕɯ} 	\ipa{χsɯm} 	\ipa{ki} \\
this \textsc{1sg.poss}-son three this \\
\glt These three sons of mine.
\end{exe}

Adjectival stative verbs can serve as noun modifier only in the S/A-participle (in \ipa{kɯ--}), and the [noun+adjective] constituent should be analyzed as a head-internal relative clause.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:tCheme.XsWm}
\gll
[\ipa{tɕʰeme}^{head} 	\ipa{kɯ-mpɕɯ\textasciitilde{}mpɕɤr}]_{\textsc{rc}} 	\ipa{ʑo} 	\ipa{χsɯm} 	\ipa{ɲɯ-nɯ-ɬoʁ-nɯ}  \\
girl \textsc{nmlz:S/A-emph}\textasciitilde{}be.beautiful \textsc{emph} three \textsc{ipfv-auto}-come.out-\textsc{pl} \\
\glt Three beautiful girls come out of it (each day).
\end{exe}

Noun modifying other noun normally appear before them as in \ref{ex:GW.nWrJAlpu}. The head noun has an obligatory possessive prefix coreferent with the modifier noun, and a genitive postposition \ipa{ɣɯ} can be optionally added.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:GW.nWrJAlpu}
\gll
\ipa{aʑo}  	\ipa{ndzaʁlaŋ}  	\ipa{ɣɯ}  	\ipa{nɯ-rɟɤlpu}  	\ipa{ŋu-a}  	\ipa{tɕe,}  
 \\
\textsc{1sg} Jambudvîpa \textsc{gen} \textsc{3pl.poss}-king  be:\textsc{fact}-\textsc{1sg} \textsc{lnk} \\
\glt I am the king of the people of Jambudvîpa.
\end{exe}

However, there is a  restricted subclass of possessed nouns referring to old or ragged objects such as \ipa{ɯ-do} `old (of animals)', \ipa{ɯ-mbe} `old (of clothes)', \ipa{ɯ-ɴqra} `shabby' which are strictly postnominal.


\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:Wmbe}
\gll
\ipa{tɯ-rcu} 	\ipa{ɯ-mbe} 	\ipa{ci} 	\ipa{to-ŋga} \\
\textsc{indef.poss}-leather.jacket \textsc{3sg.poss}-old \textsc{indef} \textsc{evd}-wear \\
\glt He wore an old leather jacket.
\end{exe}

Japhug is an exclusively postpositional language. Common postpositions include the ergative / instrumental \ipa{kɯ}, the comitative \ipa{cʰo} `with' and the locative \ipa{zɯ} and \ipa{tɕu}. The locative postpositions have a vague locative meaning, and can indicate either a fixed position within or on the surface of an entity, or motion into or from it (they differ in that \ipa{zɯ} cannot follow a demonstrative). Relator nouns are also similar to postpositions, but are morphologically possessed nouns with an obligatory possessive prefix, as the dative \ipa{ɯ-ɕki} or \ipa{ɯ-pʰe} (usage depends on  idiolects) or locative relator nouns such as \ipa{ɯ-ŋgɯ} `inside' or \ipa{ɯ-taʁ} `on' and can always be optionally followed by the locative postposition \ipa{zɯ}.

\section{Simple clauses} 

Japhug has strict verb-final word order. Only a few elements can appear after a verb: sentence final particles, the adverb \ipa{ntsɯ} `always', ideophones and right-dislocated constituents.

Transitive sentences tend to have at least one covert argument (which is then always interpreted as being definite), but when all arguments are overt the canonical word order is A-P-verb, the A being obligatorily marked with the ergative \ipa{kɯ} unless it is a first or second person pronoun (see \ref{ex:WkaGW}).

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:WkaGW}
\gll
\ipa{rɟɤlpu} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{kɯ} 	\ipa{pɣɤtɕɯ} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{ɯ-kaɣɯ} 	\ipa{ɯ-ŋgɯ} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{tɕu} 	\ipa{pjɤ-nɯ-rku.} \\
king \textsc{dem} erg bird \textsc{dem} \textsc{3sg.poss}-silver.necklace \textsc{3sg}-inside \textsc{dem} \textsc{loc} \textsc{evd:down-auto}-put.in \\
\glt The king put the bird in his necklace.
\end{exe}

Right-dislocated elements (afterthoughts) keep their postpositions or relator nouns, as in \ref{ex:tungo.Nu}.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:tungo.Nu}

\glt They say that the moon is sick, the Tibetans. (Moon eclipse)
\end{exe}

\section{Comparative}

Japhug comparative constructions are illustrated by example \ref{ex:comp1}: the standard is marked by the comparative postpositions \ipa{sɤz} or \ipa{staʁ}, while the comparee can optionally be followed by a marker \ipa{kɯ} homophonous with the ergative / instrumental.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:comp1}
\gll  \ipa{ɯ-ʁi}   	\ipa{sɤz}   	\ipa{ɯ-pi}   	\ipa{nɯ}   	\ipa{\textbf{kɯ}}   	\ipa{mpɕɤr}     \\

\glt The elder sister is more beautiful than the younger sister. (elicited)
\end{exe}

There is a degree construction in which adjectival stative verbs are nominalized with the prefix \ipa{tɯ--} with a possessive prefix coreferent with the S, followed either by a finite verb indicating degree (most commonly \ipa{saχaʁ} `be extremely ...') or by a clause containing a simile describing the degree of the property.


\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:YWsWxtCur}
\gll 
\ipa{mtɕhi}  	\ipa{ɯ-mat}  	\ipa{rca}  	\ipa{ɯ-tɯ-tɕur}  	\ipa{saχaʁ.}  	\ipa{ɯ-tɯ-tɕur}  	\ipa{\textbf{kɯ}}  	[\ipa{tɯ-kɯr}  	\ipa{ɯ-ŋgɯ}  	\ipa{lú-wɣ-rku}  	\ipa{qhe}  	\ipa{maka}  	\ipa{ɲɯ-sɯ-ɤmɯzɣɯt}  	\ipa{qhe,}  	\ipa{tɯ-phoŋbu}  	\ipa{ra}  	\ipa{kɯnɤ}  	\ipa{ɲɯ-sɯx-tɕur}  	\ipa{kɯ-fse}  	\ipa{ɕti}]  \\

\glt `The fruit of the sea-buckthorn is very sour, so sour that when one puts it in one's mouth, it makes it completely (sour), and it is as if one's (whole) body became sour.' (Sea-buckthorn, 66)
\end{exe}

Superlative can be expressed by the adverb \ipa{stu} `most', but the most common construction is a construction combining the negative existential copula with a nominalized predicate and an equative adjunct in \ipa{kɯ-fse} `like ...' as in \ref{ex:kWtu.me}.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:kWtu.me}
\gll 
\ipa{kʰɯna}  	\ipa{kɯ-fse}  	\ipa{ʑo} 	\ipa{ɯ-tsʰuxtoʁ}  	\ipa{kɯ-tu}  	\ipa{me}  	\ipa{kʰi} \\

\end{exe}

%\glt What is the best medicine ?
%\end{exe}
%



\section{Relativization}
Japhug relative clauses can be classified according to two main criteria: finiteness of the verb in the clause and  place / presence of head noun.

Non-finite relative clauses have a verb in either one of the three participles. The S/A-participle in \ipa{kɯ--} is used for relativizing the S, the A or the possessor of an argument, as in \ref{ex:WkWnWmbrApW} (note that the presence of ergative marking on the A show that the noun phrase \ipa{tɤpɤtso} \ipa{ci} `a boy' belongs to the relative, as the main verb \ipa{jɤ-ɣe} `he came' is intransitive).

\begin{exe}
   \ex  \label{ex:WkWnWmbrApW}
\gll [\ipa{tɤpɤtso}  	\ipa{ci}  	\ipa{kɯ}  	<yangma> 	\ipa{ɯ-kɯ-nɯmbrɤpɯ}]_{\textsc{rc}} 	\ipa{ci}  	\ipa{jɤ-ɣe}  \\
boy \textsc{indef} \textsc{erg} bicycle \textsc{3sg-nmlz:A}-ride \textsc{indef} \textsc{pfv}-come[II] \\
\glt A boy who was riding a bicycle arrived. (Pear story, Chenzhen, 5)
\end{exe}



The P-participle in \ipa{kɤ--} is used for either P, the object of semi-transitive verbs and both the T and the R of secundative ditransitive verbs (\ref{ex:tajmag}). 

     \begin{exe}
   \ex \label{ex:tajmag}
   \gll
[\ipa{aʑo}  	\ipa{a-mɤ-kɤ-sɯz}]_{\textsc{rc}}  	\ipa{tɤjmɤɣ}  	\ipa{nɯ}  	\ipa{kɤ-ndza}  	\ipa{mɤ-naz-a}\\
\textsc{1sg} \textsc{1sg-neg-nmlz:P}-know mushroom \textsc{dem} \textsc{inf}-eat \textsc{neg}-dare-\textsc{1sg}\\
\glt I do not dare to eat mushrooms that I do not know. (\ipa{mbrɤʑɯm},103)
\end{exe}

The oblique participle can occur in relatives whose relativized element is either an time or place adjunct, an instrument (marked with the ergative / instrumental \ipa{kɯ} in the original sentence), an argument marked with the comitative postposition \ipa{cʰo} (example \ref{ex:WsAmWmi}) or the recipient of an indirective verb (\ref{ex:WsAfCAt}).

     \begin{exe}
   \ex \label{ex:WsAmWmi}
 \gll 
\ipa{tɕe}   	[\ipa{ɯʑo}   	\ipa{ɯ-sɤ-ɤmɯmi}]\rc{}   	\ipa{nɯ}   	\ipa{dɤn}   	\ipa{ma}   	\ipa{ca}   	\ipa{kɯ-fse}   	\ipa{qaʑo}   	\ipa{kɯ-fse,}   	\ipa{tsʰɤt}   	\ipa{kɯ-fse,}   	 \ipa{ɯʑo}   	\ipa{cho}   	\ipa{kɯ-naχtɕɯɣ}   	\ipa{sɯjno,}   	\ipa{xɕɤj}   	\ipa{ma}   	\ipa{mɤ-kɯ-ndza}   	\ipa{nɯ} \ipa{ra}   	\ipa{cho}   	\ipa{nɯ}   	\ipa{amɯmi-nɯ}   	\ipa{tɕe,}   \\
\textsc{lnk} it \textsc{3sg-nmlz:oblique}-be.in.good.terms \topic{}  be.many:\textsc{fact} because water.deer \textsc{nmlz:S}-be.like sheep \textsc{nmlz:S}-be.like goat  \textsc{nmlz:S}-be.like it with  \textsc{nmlz:S}-be.identical herbs grass apart.from \textsc{neg-nmlz:A}-eat \textsc{dem} \textsc{pl} with \textsc{dem}  be.in.good.terms:\textsc{fact}-\textsc{pl} \textsc{lnk} \\
\glt The (animals) that are in good terms with the rabbit are many, it is in good terms with those that only eat grass, like water deer, sheep or goats. (Rabbit, 33-4)
\end{exe}

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:WsAfCAt}
\gll
[\ipa{ɯ-sɤ-fɕɤt}]\rc{} 
\ipa{pjɤ-me} 	\ipa{qʰe} 	\ipa{tɕe} 	\ipa{tɤpɤtso} 	\ipa{ɯ-ɕki} 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{tɕu} 	\ipa{nɯra} 	\ipa{tɕʰi} 	\ipa{pɯ-kɯ-fse} 	\ipa{nɯra} 	\ipa{pjɤ-fɕɤt.} \\
\textsc{3sg-nmlz:oblique}-tell \textsc{pst.evd}-not.exist \textsc{lnk} \textsc{lnk} boy \textsc{3sg-dat} \textsc{dem} \textsc{loc} \textsc{dem:pl} what \textsc{pst-nmlz:S}-be.like  \textsc{dem:pl} \textsc{evd}-tell \\
\glt She had no one (else) to tell it to, so she told the boy everything that had happened. (The smart five years old, adapted from the Arabian Nights)
\end{exe} 

Finite relative clauses are limited to the relativization of P, the object of semi-transitive verbs, the theme of indirect verbs (\ref{ex:tutianw}) or the recipient or the theme of secundative verbs.

     \begin{exe}
   \ex \label{ex:tutianw}
 \gll \ipa{nɯ}  	[\ipa{qajɯ}  	\ipa{kɯ-ɲaʁ}  	\ipa{tu-ti-a}]_{\textsc{rc}}  	\ipa{nɯ}  	\ipa{nɯ}  	\ipa{kɯ-fse}  	\ipa{ɲɯ-βze}  	\ipa{ɲɯ-ŋu}  \\
\textsc{dem} worm \textsc{nmlz:S}-black \textsc{ipfv}-say-\textsc{1sg} \textsc{dem}  \textsc{dem} \textsc{nmlz:S}-be.like \textsc{ipfv}-grow \textsc{testim}-be \\
\glt The black worm that I was talking about grows like that. (\ipa{kɯpɤz}, 30)
\end{exe}

While inverse marking does not occur in non-finite relative clauses, it is possible in finite ones as in \ref{ex:inverse.relative}. Inverse marking has no effect on the syntactic pivot (in this sentence, the ditransitive verb \ipa{sɯxɕɤt} is secundative, and the relativized element is the T). In particular, it does not make any argument or adjunct other than the P or the T (in particular, the A) accessible to relativization with a finite relative.

     \begin{exe}
   \ex \label{ex:inverse.relative}
 \gll
\ipa{tɤ-tɕɯ}  	\ipa{nɯ}  	\ipa{kɯ,}  	[\ipa{saŋrɟɤz}  	\ipa{ra}  	\ipa{kɯ}  	\ipa{pɯ́-wɣ-sɯxɕɤt}]_{\textsc{rc}}  	\ipa{ɣɯ}  	\ipa{kʰɤndɯn}  	\ipa{nɯ}  	\ipa{ɯ-rʑaβ}  	\ipa{χsɯm}  	\ipa{nɯ}  	\ipa{pjɤ-sɯxɕɤt}  \\
\textsc{indef.poss}-boy \textsc{dem} \textsc{erg} Buddha \textsc{pl} \textsc{erg} \textsc{pfv-inv}-teach   \textsc{gen} sûtra \textsc{dem} \textsc{3sg.poss}-wife three \textsc{dem} \textsc{evd}-teach \\
\glt The boy taught his three wives the sûtra that the Buddhas had taught him.
\end{exe}


Finite relatives present some syntactic features distinguishing them from independent clauses. First, the possessive prefixes in the sentence referring to a core argument can be neutralized to the indefinite possessive prefix. In \ref{ex:tApAro} for instance, the first singular possessive form \ipa{a-pɤro}`my present (to him)' is the only possible form in the corresponding main clause, but the indefinite possessive form \ipa{tɤ-pɤro} `a present' can be used instead in the relative clause.

		\begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:tApAro}
\gll
	[\ipa{tɤ-pɤro}  	\ipa{nɯ-mbi-t-a}]_{\textsc{rc}}  	\ipa{tɤ-rɟit}  	\ipa{nɯ}  	\ipa{a-tɕɯ}  	\ipa{ŋu}   \\
	\textsc{indef.poss}-present \textsc{pfv}-give-\textsc{pst:tr-1sg} 	\textsc{indef.poss}-child \topic{} \textsc{1sg.poss}-son be:\textsc{fact} \\
\glt The child to whom I gave a present is my son. (Elicited)
 	  \end{exe} 
 	  
Second, the verb of a finite relative clause can undergo totalitative reduplication, a morphological process normally restricted to nominalized verb forms that has a quantifying meaning `all' (in reference to the relativized element, in this case normally the P).

  \begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:pWpaGWt}
\gll
\ipa{tɕe}  	[\ipa{nɯ} \ipa{ra}  	\ipa{tɤrɤkusna} 	\ipa{nɯ}  	\ipa{pɯ\textasciitilde{}pa-ɣɯt}]_{\textsc{rc}}  	\ipa{nɯ}  	\ipa{lo-ji-ndʑi}  \\
\textsc{lnk} \textsc{dem} \textsc{pl} good.crops \topic{} \textsc{total\textasciitilde{}pfv:3$\rightarrow$3:down}-bring \topic{} \textsc{evd}-plant-\textsc{du} \\
\glt They^{du} planted all the crops that she had brought (from heaven). (flood3.111)
\end{exe}

Both head-internal (see examples \ref{ex:WkWnWmbrApW}) and prenominal relatives (\ref{ex:tajmag}, \ref{ex:inverse.relative}) are found in Japhug. Head-internal relatives are possible for the relativization of core arguments and possessors, while prenominal relatives are required for all oblique arguments and adjuncts. Prenominal relatives are also possible for core arguments, except S in the case of stative verbs.

\section{Complementation}
In Japhug, complement clauses, like relatives, can be either finite or non-finite. Non-finite complement clauses include four types. Infinitive clauses, with the verb prefixed in \ipa{kɤ--}, are found with a wide range of verbs, including modal verbs (\ref{ex:erg.rga}), some phasal verbs, and causative verbs. 


 \begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:erg.rga}
\gll
[\ipa{paʁ}  	\ipa{ra}  	\ipa{kɯ}  	\ipa{kɤ-ndza}]  	\ipa{wuma}  	\ipa{ʑo}  	\ipa{rga-nɯ}  \\
pig \textsc{pl} \textsc{erg} \textsc{inf}-eat very \textsc{emph}  like:\textsc{fact}-\textsc{pl} \\
 \glt Pigs like to eat it.
\end{exe}

Note that \ipa{paʁ} \ipa{ra} \ipa{kɯ} `pigs' is marked with ergative \ipa{kɯ} and thus belongs to the complement clause (whose main verb \ipa{ndza} is transitive) and is not an argument of the main clause (whose main verb \ipa{rga} is intransitive, and cannot take arguments in \ipa{kɯ}).


S/A-participial clauses are used for the purposive complements of motion verbs and the complements of the verbs \ipa{ʑɣɤpa} and \ipa{nɯɕpɯz} `pretend' and of the phasal verb \ipa{rɤŋgat} `prepare for, be about to', as in \ref{ex:akWRndW}.


 \begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:akWRndW}
\gll
\ipa{nɤʑo}  	\ipa{a-kɯ-ʁndɯ}  	\ipa{tu-tɯ-rɤŋgat}  	\ipa{tɕe,}  	\ipa{nɤ-pʰɯŋgɯ}  	\ipa{rdɤstaʁ}  	\ipa{ɲɯ-tɯ-rke}  	\ipa{ɲɯ-ŋu}  \\
\textsc{2sg} \textsc{1sg-nmlz}:S/A-hit \textsc{ipfv}-2-prepare \textsc{lnk} \textsc{2sg.poss}-folds.of.clothes stone \textsc{ipfv}-2-put.in[III] \textsc{testim}-be \\
\glt You have put a stone in your clothes, and are about to hit me.
\end{exe}

A few verbs, such as \ipa{ʑa} `start' and \ipa{rɲo} `experience', take bare infinitive complements(\ref{ex:tuZanW}) when the complement verb is transitive. Unlike the two previous types of complement clauses, bare infinitival clauses appear to be unattested in Tshobdun and other Rgyalrong languages (\citealt{sun12complementation}).

 \begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:tuZanW}
\gll
\ipa{tɕe}  	\ipa{pɤjkʰu}  	\ipa{pjɯ-si}  	\ipa{ɕɯŋgɯ}  	\ipa{ʑo}  	\ipa{ɯ-ɕa}  	\ipa{ɯ-ndza}  	\ipa{tu-ʑa-nɯ}  	\ipa{ɕti.}  \\
\textsc{lnk} yet \textsc{ipfv}-die before \textsc{emph} \textsc{3sg.poss}-meat \textsc{3sg-bare.inf}:eat \textsc{ipfv}-start-\textsc{pl}  be.\textsc{affirmative}:\textsc{fact} \\
 \glt They start eating it before has died.
\end{exe}

Causative verbs derived from adjectival stative verbs can be used with a bare infinitive complement, the complement indicating the action and the causative verb the manner or degree in which the action is performed, as in \ref{ex:koGAtChom} and in \ref{ex:atAtWGABdi} with the complex predicate \ipa{ɯ-pɯ} \ipa{--pa} `preserve, keep, take care of' in the complement clause.

 \begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:koGAtChom}
\gll
\ipa{cʰa} \ipa{ɯ-tsʰi} \ipa{ko-ɣɤ-tɕʰom} \\
alcohol \textsc{3sg.poss}-\textsc{bare.inf}:drink \textsc{evd-caus}-be.too.much \\
\glt He drunk too much alcohol.
\end{exe}
 \begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:atAtWGABdi}
\gll
\ipa{ɯ-pɯ}  	\ipa{ɯ-pa}  	\ipa{a-tɤ-tɯ-ɣɤ-βdi}  	\ipa{ma}  \\
\textsc{3sg.poss}-CP:keep \textsc{3sg.poss}-\textsc{bare.inf}:CP:keep \textsc{irr-pfv-2-caus}-be.well \textsc{lnk} \\
\glt You will have to keep it well.
\end{exe}

Note that the causative verb takes the directional prefix normally selected by the complement verb: \ipa{tsʰi} `drink' and \ipa{ɯ-pɯ} \ipa{--pa} `preserve'  respectively select the `east' \ipa{ko-- kɤ--} and `up' \ipa{to-- tɤ--} directional prefixes.

No verb \textit{requires} a bare infinitive complement. The phasal verb \ipa{ʑa} `start' can also be used with an action nominal in \ipa{tɯ--} (see \citealt[6-9]{jacques14antipassive}), and \ipa{rɲo} `experience' and the causative verbs can also take a \ipa{kɤ--}infinitival complement.

Finite complement clauses appear with some speech, thought and modal verbs, but most verbs taking finite complements also accept infinitival complements.

Complement clauses do not necessarily occur as P-argument or adjuncts, some are used in S position, as noun complements or in topical position as in \ref{ex:tWkhAftsWG}.


 \begin{exe}
\ex \label{ex:tWkhAftsWG}
\gll
[\ipa{taqaβ} 	\ipa{ci} 	\ipa{cʰɯ́-wɣ-lɤt}] 	\ipa{nɯ} 	\ipa{tɯ-kʰɤftsɯɣ} 	\ipa{tu-kɯ-ti} 	\ipa{ŋu} \\
needle once \textsc{ipfv-inv}-throw \textsc{dem} one-stitch \textsc{ipfv-genr}-say be:\textsc{fact} \\
\glt Passing the needle once (in the fabric) is called `a stitch'.
\end{exe}

Finite complement clauses, like relative clauses, can appear with inverse marking in Japhug, as shown by example \ref{ex:tWkhAftsWG}.

%
%Although Japhug has several converbs (in addition to the infinitives, which can be used converbially), the frequency of these converbs in texts is relatively low, and there is in all cases a corresponding finite clause linking construction with a similar meaning (\citealt{jacques14linking}). Japhug disallows sequences of converbs, which is unusual among the languages of the Tibetan area. 
%
%
%Some constructions require a subordinate clause in a particular TAM category, regardless of the tense of the main clause. For instance, temporal subordinate clauses with the postposition \ipa{ɕɯŋgɯ} `before' are always in the imperfective, even if the main clause is in the perfective or evidential as in \ref{ex:CWNgW}.
%
%\begin{exe}

%\textsc{ipfv:down}-come-\textsc{1sg} before \textsc{lnk} \textsc{evd}-go.back \\
% \glt He went back before I came (home).
%\end{exe}
%
%There is a wide range of conditional constructions in Japhug, each of which has dedicated morphological marking. The verb of the protasis of real conditionals is marked either by the interrogative prefix or by reduplication of the first syllable (or first morpheme if shorter than a syllable), as illustrated by \ref{ex:CWCkAtshita} (iterative coincidence conditional), \ref{ex:mWmAkWtsWma} (implicative conditional).
